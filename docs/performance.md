# Serving performance

## V100 Duo measurement and acceptance

The active port uses two Tesla V100-SXM2 16 GB cards, CUDA 12.8 (`sm_70`), and the local
`qwen3.8-27b/gguf-q4-k-m` artifact converted from LM Studio's Qwen3.8-27B Q4_K_M GGUF.
On the fixed code-generation workload below, three valid runs at exactly 85,000 occupied prompt
tokens measured **53.4075 ± 0.0639 committed decode tok/s** (mean ± sample standard deviation),
**18.68% above** the user's approximately 45 tok/s baseline. Each run measures 512 decode tokens
with 180,000-token capacity. This establishes the speed result for this prompt and output window;
it does not guarantee the same speed on every prompt. The RTX 5090 tables later in this document
are inherited results for different hardware and weight profiles.

Startup disables direct P2P for Linux IOMMU `DMA` and `DMA-FQ` domains, verifies the selected
transfer route with exact byte comparisons in both directions, and rejects startup if verification
fails. The host of this historical Q4_K_M measurement used `DMA-FQ` and therefore CUDA's
host-staged copies; the current host has no IOMMU translation and runs direct NVLink P2P (see
[GSQ-RCO IQ3_S](#v100-duo-gsq-rco-iq3_s-gguf-blocks)). This route passes the collective
suite, including different tensor sizes, guards and 64 consecutive rounds, and the three public
Engine CUDA Graph measurements below. The INT8 attention test also passes its independent FP64
oracle at 85K occupied keys for all four queries, all 24 heads and every visible key, with TP1/TP2 comparisons
and exact cache checks. Real-model MTP/non-MTP teacher forcing and graph/eager regression gates
pass on their short-prompt fixtures. The source Q4_K/Q6_K codes and scales remain unchanged;
these numerical and state checks support the tested route without asserting universal quality
parity for all prompts.

| Setting | V100 Duo comparison profile |
|---|---|
| GPUs | 2 x Tesla V100-SXM2 16 GB, TP2, devices 0 and 1 |
| CUDA compile/runtime | 12.8 / 12.8 |
| Artifact | `qwen3.8-27b/gguf-q4-k-m`; original Q4_K/Q6_K blocks and scales |
| Request mode | One active request |
| Context capacity | 180,000 tokens, native RoPE |
| Primary occupied context | Exactly 85,000 actual prompt tokens |
| KV cache | INT8 group-64; compared with LM Studio's Q8 KV configuration |
| CUDA Graph | Enabled |
| Prefill chunk | 1,024 tokens |
| NInfer MTP | Fixed draft window of three; optimized proposal head (`--lm-head-draft`) |
| Measured output window | 512 decode tokens plus the first token from prefill; three repetitions |
| TP2 transport | Verified CUDA host-staged copies on the IOMMU host used for this measurement |

NInfer's `--mtp-draft-tokens 3` uses a fixed three-token proposal window, shortened when the remaining
output or context budget requires it. Verification may accept zero drafts. This is distinct from
LM Studio's maximum-three/minimum-zero draft configuration: a minimum draft count of zero permits
its proposal policy to vary how many drafts it attempts, whereas zero accepted drafts describes
the verification result. The two engines therefore use related, but different, MTP schedules.

| Repetition | Committed decode wall tok/s |
|---|---:|
| 1 | 53.3498 |
| 2 | 53.3966 |
| 3 | 53.4761 |
| Mean ± sample standard deviation | **53.4075 ± 0.0639** |

Every repetition produced the same 513 token IDs, with no EOS/EOG token in the captured window,
and accepted **364 / 444 drafts (81.98%)**. Prefill took **298.132–298.154 s** per repetition and
is excluded from decode throughput. Host CPU use was approximately one of 32 logical cores;
observed GPU memory use was **13,768 / 13,454 MiB**, including about 313 MiB of desktop use on GPU 0.

A separate short-input code-chat measurement used 512 prompt tokens, the same 180,000-token
capacity and execution settings, one warmup, and three 256-token decode windows. Its wall decode
rates were **59.9644, 60.0509 and 60.0721 tok/s**, or **60.0291 ± 0.0571 tok/s** (mean ± sample
standard deviation), with **65.89%** draft acceptance. All three 257-token outputs were identical
and EOS/EOG-free. This exceeds the reported 57 tok/s peak numerically, but the unspecified
occupancy of that peak prevents a matched comparison; it is not the 85K acceptance result.

The user-reported LM Studio baseline is approximately **45 committed decode tok/s at 85K occupied
context**, with a reported **57 tok/s peak** whose context occupancy was not specified. The
approximately 40 tok/s figure at longer context is an estimate. These observations are the
acceptance reference; the 18.68% gain is relative to the reported 45 tok/s value, rather than the
matched-engine measurement below. The 57 tok/s peak has not been exceeded by this 85K result and lacks
the context occupancy needed for a like-for-like comparison.

A matched diagnostic run of LM Studio's CUDA backend **2.33.0** used its automatic two-GPU split,
the same source GGUF and exact 85,000 prompt IDs, Q8 KV, a requested 180,000-token capacity
(rounded by the backend to 180,224), and maximum-three/minimum-zero MTP. Both engines used greedy
sampling and generated 513 output tokens: one from prefill and 512 in the measured decode interval.

| Engine | Decode tok/s | Prefill seconds | Accepted / drafted |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| NInfer V100 Duo, mean of three runs | **53.4075** | 298.144 | 364 / 444 per run (81.98%) |
| LM Studio CUDA 2.33.0, one run | **35.4977** | 185.374 | 365 / 440 (82.95%) |

The LM run decoded for **14.42347 s**, evaluated all 85,000 prompt tokens without cache reuse,
and stopped at the output limit without any EOS/EOG token. NInfer's decode rate is **50.45% higher**
in this comparison, with similar MTP acceptance. Its prefill is **1.61 times as long**, so this is
a decode improvement, not a reduction in cold-request completion latency. The single LM run is
a diagnostic, not a stable average, and does not replace the user's approximately 45 tok/s
acceptance baseline.

Measure committed output tokens per decode second, excluding the first token produced by prefill.
Rejected draft tokens do not count as output. Report repeated measurements and context occupancy;
a short-prompt result at `--max-context 180000` cannot establish performance at 85K occupied tokens.
Use the same prompt content and sampling for the final LM Studio comparison. Record GPU memory,
power and aggregate CPU use; keep CPU below the user's approximately 85% ceiling.

The public Engine benchmark provides a reproducible greedy diagnostic. The code-chat corpus below
uses the artifact's embedded tokenizer and chat template with thinking disabled, distinct repository
source excerpts, and a final bounded blocking task-queue implementation request. The tool trims the
source excerpt body to make the complete prompt exactly 85,000 tokens, preserving the task and
assistant prefix; it does not repeat excerpts to fill the context. Feed the saved token IDs directly
to both engines, without applying another template or decoding and retokenizing them. Keep the
corpus command's `--output-tokens 1024`: this is part of the fixed prompt's wording, independent of
the measured 512-token decode window. The bundled 65,536-token benchmark corpus is too short for
this case:

```

`-pg 85000,512` fixes the output window at 513 tokens: one from prefill and 512 from decode.
Each measured decode follows the full 85K-token prefill, and the Engine primes its CUDA Graphs
before use; `--warmup 0` omits an additional benchmark warmup generation. For a cross-engine
wall-time decode comparison, compute each repetition's rate as
`512 / (timings.total_seconds - timings.first_token_seconds)`. Both timestamps include the same
prompt preparation and submission origin, so subtraction leaves the interval from first-token
commit to request completion, including work between decode rounds. The separately reported
`decode_output_tok_s` uses accumulated Program decode-phase time and excludes some Engine work
between rounds.

`--capture-generation` retains each measured repetition's raw text and token IDs under
`reps[].generation`. NInfer's fixed-budget benchmark disables model-default stopping but can emit
EOS tokens. An accepted repetition must contain no EOS within its entire 513-token output window;
also inspect the captured text for repetition before counting its rate as useful answer throughput.
The matched 512-token LM comparison uses `compare_llama.py` with `ignore_eos=false`, without
EOG-token logit biases. It requires `tokens_predicted=513` and a non-EOS ending; otherwise it saves
the returned output and rejects the repetition instead of calculating a complete-window rate.

The comparison used this local LM Studio backend command, leaving GPU splitting automatic:

```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/z/.lmstudio/extensions/backends/vendor/linux-llama-cuda-vendor-v1 \
/home/z/.lmstudio/extensions/backends/llama.cpp-linux-x86_64-nvidia-cuda-avx2-2.33.0/llama-server \

  --threads 16 --threads-batch 24 \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18081 --no-webui
```

With that backend ready, run the matched single-round diagnostic using Python 3.11:

```bash
.venv/bin/python3 tools/v100/compare_llama.py \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:18081 \
  --corpus /tmp/v100-code-85000.ids \
  --prompt-tokens 85000 --decode-tokens 512 --repetitions 1 \
  --output /tmp/llama-v100-duo-85000.json
```

This one-round LM Studio diagnostic does not establish a stable average. The NInfer comparison
against the user's 45 tok/s baseline uses the three measured repetitions above.

These are fixed-window code-generation throughput measurements, not evaluations of whether the
generated code correctly solves the requested programming task.

Quality checks are separate from timing. Preserving the source quantization blocks is an exact
conversion claim; control-tensor transformations and floating-point operators require numerical
oracles. Real-model MTP/non-MTP teacher forcing, graph/eager comparisons and cross-device state
checks qualify the execution path. A plausible answer or a faster kernel alone is insufficient to
claim unchanged model quality or an end-to-end speedup.

## V100 Duo prefill investigation

The three application labels below are *length proxies*, not runs of Pi agent, Codex, or Claude
Code. All requests consume the same fixed `bench/fixtures/bench_corpus.ids` through the public
Engine's raw-token route; each measured request has cold prefix state, one generated token, and no
MTP decode. This controls the workload when comparing prefill chunk widths, but does not measure
agent tool calls, prompt quality, or model inference in 1Cat-vLLM. Token IDs are fixed; prefill
phase duration is measured inside Engine, excluding load, preparation, and decode.

On September 28, 2026, the local dual Tesla V100-SXM2 16 GB host (CUDA 12.8), official
`/home/gareth/models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer` v3 artifact (23,719,715,844 bytes), TP2,
INT8 group-64 KV, and 32,768-token capacity produced the following. Each cell is the mean of
two measured requests after one discarded warmup, using `ninfer_bench` and the same corpus:

| Length proxy | Prompt | Chunk 1,024 (seconds; tok/s) | Chunk 2,048 | Chunk 4,096 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Pi agent | 1,024 | 0.982; 1,042.3 | 0.984; 1,041.1 | 0.983; 1,041.3 |
| Codex | 10,240 | 10.051; 1,018.8 | 9.295; 1,101.7 | 9.040; 1,132.7 |
| Claude Code | 20,480 | 20.639; 992.3 | 19.155; 1,069.2 | 18.549; 1,104.1 |

This is a **chunk configuration** result, not a new operator speedup or a comparison of the two
engines. The 4,096-token chunk gains 11.2% at 10K and 11.3% at 20K relative to 1,024; at 1K,
all chunks are within 0.2%. Per-rank reserved workspace rises from 505,670,144 bytes (1,024)
to 654,576,128 (2,048) and 952,388,096 (4,096), while the observed arena peak at 20K rises
from 273,686,528 to 369,115,136 and 559,972,352 bytes. Larger chunks cost memory *before* a
request starts, even when it is only 1K long.

The 200,000-token production context plus MTP3 rejects a 2,048 chunk at Engine reservation:
5,388,112,128 bytes requested against 5,370,736,128 available. At 196,608 capacity, MTP3 and
2,048 do fit, with 65,018,112 bytes of planned slack; a one-request cold 20,480-token check
returned 19.242 s (1,064.4 tok/s), versus 20.750 s (987.0 tok/s) with 1,024 at the same
capacity. This single-request production-profile check supports feasibility, **not** a stable
long-context performance average. Both requests returned the same first token (ID 864); this
is not a general numerical or quality qualification. The **previous** 200K capacity can only
be restored by passing `--max-context 200000 --prefill-chunk 1024` together. A proposed 2,048
chunk at that capacity is discarded because the memory contract does not permit it. A larger
chunk is also discarded
as an *exactly 1,024-token* optimization because it provides no measurable benefit at that
boundary; a real 1,298-token Pi request instead benefits by avoiding a second chunk.

Reproduce the 32K matrix after enabling `-DNINFER_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON` in the Volta CMake
configuration and building `ninfer_bench` with `cmake --build build-v100-duo -j --target
ninfer_bench`. Select the official artifact explicitly and keep the corpus and capacity fixed:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD/build/_deps/install/lib:/usr/local/cuda-12.8/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
for chunk in 1024 2048 4096; do
  build-v100-duo/bench/ninfer_bench \
    --weights /path/to/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
    --corpus bench/fixtures/bench_corpus.ids \
    --tp 2 --devices 0,1 --kv-dtype int8 --max-ctx 32768 \
    --prefill-chunk "$chunk" -p 1024,10240,20480 -r 2 --warmup 1
done
```

**What transfers from 1Cat-vLLM.** Its SM70 NVFP4 path (`csrc/sm70_turbomind/ops/
nvfp4_qpn4_sm70.cu`) keeps the small-M QPN route and, for admitted large M, materializes a
transient FP16 weight matrix before a tensor-core GEMM; the dense weight is *not* kept resident
across layers. NInfer already selects A16 on Volta (`src/ops/linear/nvfp4/nvfp4_config.h`) and
uses CUTLASS FP16 materialization for large-T SwiGLU, GDN input, and residual projections
(`src/ops/linear/nvfp4/nvfp4_cutlass_sm70.cu` and the affected Op plans). It does not run the
Blackwell W4A4 arithmetic on V100. The shared QPN layout is already decoded by this CUTLASS
route. Simply introducing a second materialization is not a new optimization; switching GEMM
libraries or fusing the existing epilogues would need matched Op and end-to-end tests, including
BF16-versus-FP16 casting boundaries. No arithmetic kernel is changed by this chunk sweep.

### Chunk peak and captured agent requests

Further 32K cold-prefix sweeps used the same two-V100 host, artifact, fixed-corpus prompt
sizes and two measured repetitions. The following are **whole-Engine** rates; reserved
workspace is per rank and includes the effect of the chunk selection:

| Prefill chunk | 10,240 prompt tok/s | 20,480 prompt tok/s | Reserved workspace (MiB) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1,024 | 1,018.8 | 992.3 | 482 |
| 2,048 | 1,101.7 | 1,069.2 | 624 |
| 3,072 | 1,114.7 | 1,089.6 | 766 |
| 4,096 | 1,132.7 | 1,104.1 | 908 |
| 4,608 | 1,128.0 | 1,099.3 | 979 |
| 4,864 | 1,121.5 | 1,094.5 | 1,015 |
| 5,120 | **1,146.8** | **1,107.6** | 1,050 |
| 5,376 | 1,137.9 | 1,099.9 | 1,086 |
| 6,144 | 1,103.2 | 1,052.0 | 1,192 |
| 7,168 | 1,029.9 | 989.4 | 1,334 |
| 8,192 | 986.7 | 966.5 | 1,476 |
| 16,384 | 950.5 | 948.6 | 2,921 |

The 5,120 synthetic peak is only 1.25% faster at 10K and 0.31% at 20K than 4,096,
despite reserving another 142 MiB per GPU. 8,192 and 16,384 are **discarded**, not kept as
larger-is-better routes. As a separate check, the three SDKs were invoked with the same small
repository question in an empty workspace, pointing model requests at a loopback rejecting
server. The raw JSON first-turn payloads and derived text are local to
`/tmp/ninfer-agent-prefill/` (not committed). The rendered system instructions, tool schemas
and user messages were encoded using this **artifact's tokenizer** via `ninfer_v100_corpus`,
then measured through cold NInfer Engine requests with the same TP2/INT8/32K/one-output-token
contract as the fixed-length sweep:

| First-turn SDK payload | NInfer tokens | Chunk 1,024 | Chunk 4,096 | Chunk 5,120 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Pi SDK 0.73.1 | 1,298 | 938.1 | **1,056.0** | 1,056.7 |
| Codex SDK 0.158.0 | 11,718 | 1,004.0 | **1,132.9** | 1,129.0 |
| Claude Agent SDK 0.3.283 | 16,368 | 999.7 | **1,116.7** | 1,113.7 |

Every cell is prompt tok/s from two measured repetitions after one warmup. All three chunk
settings emitted the same first token **within** each payload; this is not a cross-engine
quality check. The 4,096 choice improves Pi by 12.6%, Codex by 12.8%, and Claude by 11.7%
versus 1,024. For these realistic agent first-turn *payloads* 5,120 ties Pi and loses
slightly on both longer requests. Choose 4,096 on robustness, reserved memory and prompt
coverage; do not make the small synthetic 5,120 peak the product default.

The fast-prefill *production* selection is `--max-context 180224 --prefill-chunk 4096` with
MTP3, the optimized proposal head, and CUDA Graph decode. It gives up 19,776 context tokens
(9.9%) versus the former 200K default. At 180,224 capacity, the captured Claude prompt ran
at 993.97, 1,109.23, and 1,107.50 prefill tok/s for chunks 1,024, 4,096, and 5,120
respectively (one warmup, two measured repetitions each). Planned per-rank slack was 670.2,
343.0, and 233.9 MB respectively. The exact requested first token matched across these three
widths. At the selected 180,224/4,096 configuration, **all three** captured prompts also
completed an eight-token MTP3 decode interval through the CUDA Graph route; matching 1,024
controls returned the same nine output IDs for each prompt. This establishes a useful
functional check, not a parity guarantee for all prompts or chunk boundaries.

For the concise README prefill table, each captured first-turn request was also run
once through the public Engine under the **selected production configuration**
(180,224 capacity, 4,096 chunk, TP2, INT8 KV, optimized MTP3 and CUDA Graph):

| Captured request | Qwen tokens | First token seconds (TTFT) | Prefill seconds | Prefill tok/s |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Pi | 1,298 | 1.246371524 | 1.2463 | 1,041.46 |
| Codex | 11,718 | 10.398303200 | 10.3979 | 1,126.95 |
| Claude Agent | 16,368 | 14.711902570 | 14.7112 | 1,112.62 |

These are single cold requests with eight decode tokens after the measured prefill,
**zero warmups and one measured repetition each**. TTFT is the public Engine's
`reps[0].timings.first_token_seconds` in each captured Agent's
`*-ctx180224-c4096-mtp8.json` report: request start to first generated token,
including Engine preparation and prefill, but excluding model load, SDK startup,
network transport, HTTP streaming, and Agent tool execution. It is not a
measured first *visible character* in a running Agent UI. They are not the 32K-capacity,
two-repetition chunk-sweep figures above or a claim about interactive Agent latency.

With a real 16,368-token captured Claude prompt and eight-token MTP3 decode window at the
same 180,224 capacity, 4,096 versus 1,024 measured prefill 1,112.62 versus 994.44 tok/s
on single measured requests; both graph-prime requests and the nine generated IDs matched.
The 4,096 profile reserves 243,785,984 bytes planned slack per card before graph capture,
similar to the formerly published 196,608/1,024 headroom. At 184,320/4,096 a single
prefill+MTP3 graph request still passed (1,109.97 prefill tok/s, identical nine generated IDs)
but planned slack was only 144,563,968 bytes. We select 180,224 for additional margin, not
the tightest feasible capacity. The former 200K/1,024 capacity remains an explicit override;
do not combine that capacity with the new 4,096 default chunk.

**1Cat-vLLM's “8K” boundary** refers to the specialized SM70 Q8000/Q8192 attention
kernel's *per-request query chunk*: other shapes fall back to the general route. Its
`max_num_batched_tokens` may be 16,384 while scheduling two Q8192 chunks; 8,192 is **not**
a universal vLLM scheduler limit. NInfer's measured 8,192-token chunk is slower than 4,096
for the 10K/20K prompts and has an independent workload/precision policy.

The SDKs were stopped by the local endpoint before inference or tool calls. This captures
their original **client-side API request**, not hidden provider-added instructions, a whole
interactive transcript, or the provider's tokenization. Qwen token IDs are generated from
a JSON rendering of the system, messages and tools, not an exact provider chat-template
encoding. No Pi/Codex/Claude quality or cross-model speed claim follows. The reproduction
harness and its local-only/privacy contract are in
[`tools/v100/agent_prefill/README.md`](../tools/v100/agent_prefill/README.md).

The 1Cat-vLLM SM70 long-prefill attention (`csrc/attention/sm70_v37/` and
`csrc/attention/sm70_79t/`) separates prefix GEMM from a causal tail, packs six Q heads per
KV head, and uses FP32 online merge; the Q8000/Q8192 specialization needs a 768 MiB score
workspace per GPU and has narrow FP16/KV-alignment admission. NInfer's paged INT8 KV and BF16
query/output use a different precision and memory contract; moreover TP2 has 12 Q heads and
2 KV heads per rank, whereas that kernel admits 6 Q heads and 1 KV head per rank. Its
large-attention approach may be
worth a *separate* kernel profile and independent oracle qualification at longer occupied
contexts, but direct transplantation is not justified by the 1K/10K/20K whole-model data or
the 16 GB production headroom. Published 1Cat-vLLM long-prefill results often use TP4 on four
V100 32 GB cards, sometimes with FP8 weights/draft models; none is a like-for-like two-card
NVFP4 baseline. We therefore do not quote those throughput figures as an NInfer speed ratio.

### V100 Duo decode: pelican HTML

On September 28, 2026, the local **2 × Tesla V100-SXM2 16 GB** host, CUDA 12.8,
official Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4 artifact (`/home/gareth/models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer`),
and the production launcher (`tools/v100/ninfer-v100-duo.sh`) ran TP2, INT8 KV,
MTP3/4/5 with optimized draft head, CUDA Graph, 180,224-token context capacity,
4,096-token prefill chunks, and one active request. Each window had its own
resident server; thinking and prefix reuse were disabled. The **exact English
user prompt** was:

> Create a complete, self-contained HTML file containing inline SVG that depicts a pelican riding a bicycle. Animate it in 2D: the wheels spin and the pelican pedals. Use no external resources. The file should work by saving it as an .html file and opening it directly in a browser.

The public OpenAI Chat Completions endpoint received one user message,
`reasoning_effort: "none"`, `temperature: 0` (greedy), `seed: 42`, and
`max_tokens: 12288`. The Qwen chat template counted **74 prompt tokens**.
Each window ran three complete requests on its own resident server, with zero
prefix-cache hits and no reasoning content. All nine
stopped naturally. The speeds below use committed decode tokens divided by
`request_done.timings_seconds.decode`, namely
`(completion_tokens - 1) / decode_seconds` because prefill emits the first token.
**Peak (5 s)** is the highest single 5-second `throughput` interval's committed
decode rate across the three requests, as logged by the server (one active
request); **average** is the arithmetic mean of three full-request rates. These
are *different time windows*, so peak and average should not be treated as
statistics over identical intervals. The highest full-request rate is also
listed to disambiguate peak definitions.

| Draft window | Output tokens per run | Decode seconds (3 runs) | Peak 5 s tok/s | Peak full-request tok/s | Average full-request tok/s | Drafts accepted |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| MTP3 (default) | 9,668 | 78.9587 / 78.9618 / 78.9562 | 132.0 | 122.435 | 122.431 | 7,003 / 7,998 (87.56%) |
| MTP4 | 9,324 | 72.5892 / 72.5987 / 72.6085 | 142.4 | 128.435 | 128.418 | 7,140 / 8,748 (81.62%) |
| MTP5 | 9,881 | 72.7104 / 72.7043 / 72.7035 | **159.2** | **135.894** | **135.890** | 7,859 / 10,110 (77.73%) |

The MTP5 average is **10.99% above MTP3** on this prompt; MTP4 is **4.89%
above MTP3**. Each window produces *different text and lengths*, so these are
same-prompt throughput comparisons, not identical-output kernel speedups or a
quality-parity result. All nine responses contain fenced, complete HTML with
parsable inline SVG and no external asset references. MTP3 animates both the
wheels and the pelican's leg paths via SVG animation. MTP4/5 use CSS to spin
wheels and pedals/crank but their pelican leg and foot paths remain static,
falling short of the requested pedaling motion. Thus **MTP3 remains the default**
for this task; higher raw throughput alone does not justify changing it. Save
the HTML *inside the fence*, not the surrounding explanation. Browser rendering
and animation behavior were not independently tested. These results exclude
model load and prefill and do not describe 85K-context decode.

Reproduce the benchmark with the same local artifact and hardware:

```bash
# Start the server with one draft window (repeat for N=3, 4, 5, stopping
# the previous server before changing N):
N=3
tools/v100/ninfer-v100-duo.sh model=/home/gareth/models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  "draft-tokens=${N}" --no-thinking --no-prefix-reuse \
  --request-log-jsonl "/tmp/pelican-mtp${N}.jsonl"
# In a separate terminal, after the server is listening (set N to the same number):
N=3
prompt='Create a complete, self-contained HTML file containing inline SVG that depicts a pelican riding a bicycle. Animate it in 2D: the wheels spin and the pelican pedals. Use no external resources. The file should work by saving it as an .html file and opening it directly in a browser.'
jq -n --arg prompt "$prompt" '{model:"qwen3.8-27b",messages:[{role:"user",content:$prompt}],reasoning_effort:"none",max_tokens:12288,seed:42,temperature:0}' > /tmp/pelican-request.json
for run in 1 2 3; do
  curl -fsS -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-binary @/tmp/pelican-request.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions > "/tmp/pelican-mtp${N}-response-${run}.json"
done
jq -c 'select(.event=="request_done") | {finish:.result.finish_reason,output:.result.completion_tokens,decode_seconds:.timings_seconds.decode,decode_tok_s:((.result.completion_tokens-1)/.timings_seconds.decode)}' "/tmp/pelican-mtp${N}.jsonl"
# To reproduce the 5-second peak, retain stdout/stderr from the server and
# take the maximum decode=...tok/s from its throughput interval=5.000s lines.
```

An initial three-run attempt with `max_tokens: 3072` stopped at the output
limit in all three runs and truncated the HTML (about 121.3 decode tok/s);
those runs are **excluded** from the complete-output comparison above. An
earlier two-run MTP3 campaign measured 122.304 / 122.310 tok/s with the
same prompt and output; the table is the subsequent matched three-run campaign.

## V100 Duo text concurrency

On **September 29, 2026**, with 2 × Tesla V100-SXM2 **16 GB**, CUDA **12.8**,
`/home/gareth/models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer`, TP2, INT8 KV, optimized MTP3
and CUDA Graphs, public Engine startup checks established the following
**text-only** capacity points. The KV column is the *total shared* Main Text KV
pool, not a per-request allotment. All explicit-KV entries set it equal to the
per-request ceiling so that a single request can still fill that ceiling;
several near-ceiling requests cannot run at once.

| Slots | Prefill chunk | Context / shared KV | Primary free after startup | Result |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 2 | 4,096 | 155,648 | 703 MiB | starts; two short HTTP completions form actual two-row decode batches |
| 2 | 4,096 | 176,128 | 231 MiB | starts; little margin |
| 2 | 4,096 | 180,224 | — | rejected: runtime reservation exceeds available budget by about 2.4 MB |
| 2 | 1,024 | 180,224 | 449 MiB | starts; not near-ceiling generation-qualified |
| 2 | 1,024 | 200,000 | — | rejected: runtime reservation exceeds budget |
| 4 | 1,024 | 131,072 | 1,253 MiB | starts; benchmarked with four simultaneous short requests |
| 4 | 1,024 | 163,840 | 495 MiB | starts; not near-ceiling generation-qualified |
| 4 | 1,024 | 180,224 | — | rejected: runtime reservation exceeds budget |

At 155,648/4,096/two slots, `--kv-capacity auto` did not start; at
131,072/1,024/four slots, `auto` also did not start because it keeps 1 GiB of
planned sizing headroom. Explicit KV avoids that *planning* margin but does not
create extra physical memory. These rows bracket the tested startup boundaries,
not a proven exact maximum or a full-length multi-request qualification. The
README recommends profiles with greater free-memory margin.

For comparable **text-only multi-request throughput**, fix the same
131,072-token context, 131,072-token explicit shared KV and 1,024-token
prefill chunk at all slot counts (1, 2 and 4). Each slot uses the same
512-token prefix of `bench/fixtures/bench_corpus.ids` and greedy sampling,
disables prefix reuse and model-default stopping, and emits exactly 513 tokens
(first token during prefill plus 512 decode tokens). Submit each set of requests
simultaneously through the public Engine, discard one warmup set and measure
five sets. Wall time begins at submission and ends when all requests complete;
it excludes model load but includes prefill and decode. Aggregate output rate
is `slots × 513 / wall seconds`. This fixed synthetic window measures throughput,
not response quality or performance at 131K occupied context.

| Simultaneous requests | Primary free at startup | Mean set time (5 runs) | Mean aggregate output rate | Mean decode batch |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 1,749 MiB | 7.523 s | 68.19 tok/s | 1.00 |
| 2 | 1,585 MiB | 9.146 s | 112.18 tok/s | 1.99 |
| 4 | 1,253 MiB | 14.381 s | 142.69 tok/s | 3.57 |

The aggregate rate is the mean of the five per-set rates, **1.65×** and
**2.09×** the one-slot rate for two and four requests, respectively. Recorded
decode-row/round counts establish actual multi-row execution. All measured
outputs contain exactly 513 token IDs and repeat at each fixed slot position
across runs; the four-slot greedy outputs differ across slots and from the one/two-slot
result beginning at token 7 or 8, so this is **not** a quality-equivalence
qualification. The saved local diagnostic measurements are under
`profiles/bench/text_concurrency_20260929/` (ignored, not a distributed
fixture). The four-slot command in the README retains this measured 131K
ceiling; a 163,840-token four-slot startup is not a benchmarked recommendation.

## V100 Duo Vision and concurrency

Verified on **September 29, 2026**, using two Tesla V100-SXM2 **16 GB** cards,
CUDA **12.8**, `sm_70`, and the explicitly selected official artifact
`/home/gareth/models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer` (`qwen3.8-27b/nvfp4`). This is a
functional serving qualification, not a vision-accuracy benchmark or a sustained
throughput comparison.

```bash
tools/v100/ninfer-v100-duo.sh model=/absolute/path/to/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --vision --max-context 16384 --prefill-chunk 1024 \
  --max-concurrency 2 --kv-capacity auto \
  --port 18081 --no-thinking --greedy \
  --request-log-jsonl /tmp/ninfer-vision.jsonl --log-stats-interval-ms 500
```

Run the deterministic-scene checker against that dedicated idle server with
Python 3.11 (the verification interpreter was `/tmp/ninfer-py311/bin/python`):

```bash
/path/to/python3.11 tools/v100/check_vision_http.py --request-log /tmp/ninfer-vision.jsonl
```

Startup completed with **32,768 shared Main Text KV tokens**, sufficient for two
16,384-token entitlements; primary-rank runtime reservation was **2.76 GiB** and
actual primary-rank free memory after startup was **2.10 GiB**. INT8 KV, optimized
MTP3 and CUDA Graph were enabled. These memory figures qualify startup capacity,
not generation at the full context frontier.

The checker creates independent PPM fixtures: a red circle and a blue square on
white backgrounds. It requires the correct shape, color and background, not
exact wording. All **six** real HTTP requests passed:

| Request | Prompt tokens | Completion tokens | HTTP first content |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Red circle, 384 × 384 | 174 | 12 | 0.581 s |
| Blue square, 384 × 384 | 174 | 12 | 0.544 s |
| Blue square, 1280 × 1280; crosses prefill chunks | 1,630 | 13 | 4.042 s |
| Both images in one request | 318 | 122 | 1.039 s |
| Concurrent red-circle request | 189 | 384 | 0.543 s |
| Concurrent blue-square request | 189 | 384 | 1.126 s |

Each row is one request, not an average or percentile. HTTP first-content latency
includes local HTTP/media preparation and streaming; it excludes startup/model
load. The concurrent pair finishes at 6.107 s and 6.396 s from each request's
start, both at their 384-token output limit. Their content-stream intervals
overlap, and structured throughput records report **average decode batch size
2.00** during joint decoding. This establishes actual batched concurrent Vision
generation, not two successful but sequential HTTP responses. Every completion
record reports nonzero Vision time and there are no request errors or rejections.

A separate ordinary-decoding server (same 16K/two-slot Vision profile, INT8 KV and
CUDA Graph, but **without** `--spec` or `--lm-head-draft`) also passed all six
HTTP checks, including actual decode batch size **2.00**. Its startup resolved
the same 32,768-token KV pool with **2.53 GiB** primary-rank free memory. Thus
Vision concurrency is exercised with and without the speculative backend.

The retained public-Engine TP2 test additionally covers cross-chunk media lifetime,
MTP shifted visual embeddings, same-media reuse without re-encoding, changed and
appended media, and a visual prefix bridge against cold full prefill. See
[test commands](../tests/README.md). The 8,192-token/two-slot Vision profile also
passed the same six HTTP checks. The README's 32 GB/four-slot profile is a tuning
starting point, **not a hardware-verified result**; no 32 GB GPU is available here.

### TP2 Vision context capacity

The initial 16K/two-slot Vision profile above was a conservative functional
qualification, **not a measurement of the maximum context**. Before the
independent `--vision-max-tokens` budget was added, public Engine startups on
the same hardware, artifact, INT8 KV, optimized MTP3 and 1,024-token prefill
chunks gave these historical default-visual-budget results:

| Vision context / slots | KV policy | Resolved shared KV | Primary free after startup | Result |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| 16,384 / 2 | auto | 32,768 | 2.10 GiB | starts |
| 24,576 / 2 | auto | 44,288 | 1.14 GiB | starts; not two full ceilings |
| 24,576 / 2 | explicit 49,152 | 49,152 | 1.06 GiB | starts; two full ceilings |
| 32,768 / 2 | auto | — | — | rejected: minimum runtime plus 1 GiB headroom exceeds budget |
| 32,768 / 2 | explicit 32,768 | 32,768 | 0.56 GiB | starts; one full ceiling only |
| 32,768 / 2 | explicit 65,536 | — | — | rejected: runtime exceeds available memory |
| 49,152 / 1 | explicit 49,152 | 49,152 | 0.44 GiB | starts; little headroom |
| 65,536 / 1 | explicit 65,536 | 65,536 | 0.17 GiB | starts; not recommended |
| 180,224 / 1 | auto | — | — | rejected: runtime exceeds available memory |

These are startup/admission observations, not full-context generation tests
except where explicitly noted below. `auto` retains **1 GiB of planned sizing
headroom**; explicit capacity bypasses that policy but cannot bypass actual
memory requirements. Planned sizing headroom and measured free memory differ
because graph reservation is a bound, not necessarily fully allocated memory.

These runs planned Vision workspace for
`min(max_context, 32768)` **merged visual tokens** (four patches per token),
with a separate visual-output transient reservation. It is not sized to the
small image used by an individual request. At the verified 24K/two-slot explicit
profile, primary weights occupy **10.73 GiB**, shared scratch **2.28 GiB**, and
the complete runtime reservation **3.81 GiB**. Raising context to 32K increased
the worst-case Vision reservation as well as text KV and per-slot state. This
explained the old 16K/24K recommendation; it did **not** establish a 24K ceiling
for a text-heavy Vision workload.

The 24K/two-slot explicit 49,152-token profile also passed all six real HTTP
Vision checks (single image, cross-chunk image, multiple images and two
concurrent streams). Its concurrent decode records report batch size **2.00**.
Two additional simultaneously submitted image requests each occupied **22,180
prompt tokens** (repeated text filler plus a 384 × 384 image), requested at most
128 output tokens, and finished normally with 15 tokens identifying the correct
color, shape and background. Their text prefill phases took **22.65 / 22.66 s**;
HTTP first content arrived at **22.93 / 45.87 s** because prefill work is
scheduled on the shared executor. This verifies long occupied context with
Vision for this workload, not near-ceiling sustained decode throughput or a
guarantee of simultaneous long-prefill execution.
The current Engine independently bounds merged visual tokens per request through
`--vision-max-tokens`; frontend admission and both Vision workspace and
output-transient planning use the same bound. With 2,048 visual tokens,
1,024-token prefill chunks, two slots and `--kv-capacity auto` on the same pair:

| Context per request | Resolved shared KV | Primary free after startup | Outcome |
|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 131,072 | 137,920 | 1.14 GiB | starts; one full-length request fits |
| 147,456 | — | — | `auto` rejects minimum runtime plus 1 GiB headroom |
| 180,224 | — | — | `auto` rejects minimum runtime plus 1 GiB headroom |

With the same Vision/token/TP2/two-slot profile, sizing the shared KV pool
**explicitly to equal `max_context`** instead of asking `auto` to reserve 1 GiB
gave these additional startups. Figures are primary-rank free memory after
load, *not* unused KV capacity:

| Per-request context and shared KV | Primary free after startup | Qualification |
|---:|---:|---|
| 155,648 | 0.70 GiB (715 MiB) | real near-ceiling image prompt and concurrent Vision checked |
| 163,840 | 0.51 GiB | startup only |
| 172,032 | 0.33 GiB | startup only |
| 180,224 | 0.14 GiB | startup only; very little margin |

The **155,648/2-slot profile** was subsequently tested through the real HTTP
server. A 384 × 384 blue-square image plus repeated text occupied **154,771
prompt tokens**; the 20-token output correctly identified the blue square and
white background. Image encoding took **0.161 s**, text prefill **218.52 s**,
decode **0.319 s**, and HTTP first content **219.15 s**. Main-card memory was
**15,432 MiB used / 713 MiB free** both after startup and after that generation;
the peer held **15,124 MiB used / 1,021 MiB free** at startup and **15,126 MiB
used / 1,019 MiB free** afterward. All six real-image HTTP checks then passed
on the same profile, including the concurrent pair with recorded average
decode batch size **2.00**. This qualifies a near-ceiling *prefill* with short
decode and short-prompt batched decode, **not** long-context sustained decode
or concurrent full-length admissions. The higher-context rows were not tested
with near-ceiling requests and have substantially less free memory.

`--max-context 180224 --max-concurrency 2 --kv-capacity 180224` can start only
with explicit sizing, leaving **0.14 GiB** free; it is not a robust recommendation
and has not been qualified with a full-context Vision request. The 131K/2-slot
profile does **not** divide its context in half: one request can occupy up to
131,072 tokens, with the remaining **6,848 shared KV tokens** available for
overlapping smaller reservations. It cannot promise two full-length requests.

The recommended 131K/two-slot profile was also exercised through the HTTP
server, not just startup sizing. One cold request with a real 384 × 384 image
and **100,171 occupied prompt tokens** (repeated text filler) produced 30
completion tokens, correctly identifying the red circle and white background;
Vision encoding took **0.160 s**, text prefill **124.06 s**, and decode
**0.355 s**. A second cold request with a blue-square image occupied **130,671
prompt tokens** (401 below the 131,072 ceiling), produced 20 tokens correctly
identifying its color, shape and background, and measured **174.55 s** text
prefill, **0.160 s** Vision encoding, and **0.301 s** decode. These qualify
near-ceiling *occupied* Vision context with a short continuation, not sustained
long-context decode throughput. The same resident profile passed the six-request real-image checker,
including 1,630-token cross-chunk media, a two-image request and two concurrent
384-token streams; its concurrent decode reached **batch size 2.00**. Two
1,280 × 1,280 images in one prompt exceeded the 2,048-visual-token budget and
returned HTTP 400 `media_budget_exceeded`, confirming that reduced Vision
workspace does not silently accept larger media than was planned.

### TP2 Vision prefill and decode cost

On the same **2 × V100-SXM2 16 GB**, CUDA 12.8 and Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4 artifact,
the public Engine measured Vision disabled/enabled in separate resident processes.
Both used TP2, 16,384 context, two concurrent slots, an explicit 32,768-token
INT8 KV pool, optimized MTP3, CUDA Graph, greedy sampling and no prefix reuse.
For each case, one warmup was discarded and **five** cold requests were measured;
model load was excluded. Text inputs, fixed output limits and generated token IDs
matched exactly across the Vision switch. Prefill-only cases requested nine
output tokens (including the prefill token); the long text decode case requested
1,025 (one prefill plus 1,024 decode). Fixed-length generation ignores model
stop tokens; these are throughput measurements, not answer-quality comparisons.

| Prefill chunk | Text prompt tokens | Vision off prefill tok/s | Vision on prefill tok/s | Change |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1,024 | 512 | 885.56 | 884.26 | −0.15% |
| 1,024 | 4,096 | 1,026.81 | 1,024.61 | −0.21% |
| 1,024 | 12,288 | 1,005.03 | 1,003.21 | −0.18% |
| 4,096 | 512 | 884.00 | 883.10 | −0.10% |
| 4,096 | 4,096 | 1,150.12 | 1,148.64 | −0.13% |
| 4,096 | 12,288 | 1,119.54 | 1,118.17 | −0.12% |

At a fixed 1,024-token chunk, Vision-enabled **text-only** decode was
**119.57 tok/s** versus **119.71 tok/s** disabled (−0.12%, 1,024 decode tokens).
Two simultaneous text requests, each generating 513 tokens, formed real decode
batches (mean batch size **1.987** in both modes); their mean wall-clock makespan
was **5.610 s** versus **5.605 s** (+0.11%, including prefill). Enabling Vision
therefore caused no material text-path prefill or decode slowdown in these
workloads. Switching from a 4,096-token chunk to the README's conservative
1,024-token Vision chunk independently reduced 4,096-token *text* prefill from
1,150.12 to 1,026.81 tok/s with Vision off (−10.7%); this is a chunk-size
tradeoff, not Vision encoding overhead. Vision also started with less free memory:
**2.10 GiB** versus **3.64 GiB** at the 1,024-token chunk.

Actual image requests add work *before* first-token delivery. At the 1,024-token
chunk, a 384 × 384 PPM scene expanded to **193** prompt tokens: media preparation
averaged **0.007 s**, Vision encoding **0.158 s**, text prefill **0.369 s**, and
Engine TTFT **0.534 s**. A 1,280 × 1,280 scene expanded to **1,649** tokens:
preparation **0.066 s**, Vision encoding **2.143 s**, text prefill **1.691 s**,
and Engine TTFT **3.899 s**. TTFT excludes preparation and model load. A
384 × 384 image prompt followed by 512 decode tokens reached **120.96 tok/s**;
two such concurrent image requests formed decode batches (mean size **1.959**),
finishing 1,026 combined output tokens in **5.867 s** on average, *including*
their Vision encoding and prefill phases but excluding host-side preparation.
Image and text continuations have different
tokens and MTP acceptance, so their decode rates and pair makespans are **not**
controlled measures of Vision-induced decode overhead; the identical text
on/off comparison above is the appropriate isolation.

## V100 Duo context decay

On September 28, 2026, the same local **2 × V100-SXM2 16 GB**, CUDA 12.8,
official Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4 artifact and public `ninfer_bench` Engine route
measured TP2, 180,224-token context *capacity*, 4,096-token prefill chunks,
INT8 KV, MTP3 with optimized draft head, CUDA Graph, greedy sampling and no
prefix reuse. The `--code-chat` corpus generator assembled **30,000 / 50,000 /
100,000 / 150,000 actual occupied prompt tokens** from distinct repository
C++/CUDA source excerpts followed by the *same* bounded-queue coding task;
thinking was disabled in the rendered prompt. Each point made **two cold
requests, zero discarded warmups**, in a resident Engine, after decode graph
priming. Every request emitted one token during prefill plus **1,024 measured
decode tokens**, reaching the fixed output limit. Independent processes and
model loads were used per context length; load time is excluded. `--capture-generation`
retained the output for inspecting the fixed-length continuation.

| Occupied prompt | Prefill seconds (two runs) | TTFT mean | Prefill tok/s mean | Decode seconds (two × 1,024 tokens) | Decode tok/s mean | MTP accepted |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|
| 30,000 | 28.0109 / 28.0779 | 28.0451 s | 1,069.73 | 10.0072 / 10.0116 | 102.30 | 75.11% |
| 50,000 | 49.5062 / 49.6299 | 49.5691 s | 1,008.72 | 10.5481 / 10.5506 | 97.07 | 77.02% |
| 100,000 | 113.0494 / 113.2717 | 113.1625 s | 883.70 | 12.6322 / 12.6295 | 81.07 | 72.75% |

Prefill rate is the mean of each run's `prompt_tokens / prefill_seconds`;
decode rate is the mean of each run's `1024 / decode_seconds`. TTFT is the
Engine's `first_token_seconds` from request start, not HTTP/UI latency. At
150K occupied tokens versus 30K, prefill throughput falls 27.1% and decode
throughput falls 30.9% **on this controlled workload**. Context capacity
remains 180,224 in every row; it is the *occupied* prompt that changes.

This public-Engine benchmark feeds **raw pretokenized** Qwen chat-prompt IDs
and **disables model stops** to force equal, sufficiently long decode windows.
Captured continuations eventually repeat after an apparent natural stop, and
some emit special-token strings such as `<think>` after the stopping point.
Consequently these are *fixed-output performance measurements*, **not**
natural-stop completion times, a thinking-enabled comparison, an Agent
transcript, or evidence of 1,024 useful generated tokens. Prompt content also
grows with length, so acceptance rates change; the rows do not isolate the
attention kernel's complexity from continuation differences. The pelican
section above measures actual naturally stopped generation separately.

Reproduce with the same registered artifact and device configuration; all
files after the last needed excerpt are omitted here (the generator stops
reading once it has enough code tokens):

### V100 TPX attention experiments

We evaluated two ideas from `/tmp/ninfer-v100-tpx` on the **official Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4
artifact**, 2 x V100-SXM2 16 GB over NVLink, CUDA 12.8, TP2, INT8 group-64 KV and
4,096-token prefill chunks. All rates below are public-Engine `ninfer_bench` results, not
the external repository's published measurements. Each point has two measured requests,
no discarded warmup. The 85,000-token code-chat corpus was generated with
`ninfer_v100_corpus --code-chat 85000 --output-tokens 1024` from the listed source files in
the V100 code-corpus recipe above; the benchmark window requested one prefill token plus
128 decode tokens with MTP3 and the optimized proposal head.

| Volta prefill flash tile | Capacity | 1,024 | 10,240 | 20,480 | 85,000 | Decision |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Existing 32-column tile | 180,224 | 1,031.6 | 1,131.6 | 1,103.1 | 916.9 | Keep |
| 32-column, 8-warp / 64-key | 180,224 | 1,027.8 | 1,114.4 | 1,079.3 | 873.9 | Reject |
| 64-column, 8-warp / 64-key | 163,840 | 1,031.2 | 1,131.6 | 1,110.7 | 957.7 | Reject |

All throughput cells are prompt tokens/s. The 64-column candidate passed the attention
FP64-oracle suite but its workspace could not start at the existing 180,224-token capacity:
the reservation exceeded available device memory by about 82 MB. At 163,840 capacity its
85K rate was 4.4% above the **180,224-capacity** baseline (not a same-capacity A/B), while
the 1K/10K/20K rates were almost unchanged. Losing at least 16,384 tokens of capacity for
that narrowly scoped gain does not justify changing the production tile. The 32-column
candidate kept capacity but regressed on all measured prompt lengths. Neither tile survives.

For decode, the TP2 D256 12Q/2KV INT8 attention verification path now uses eight warps,
64 keys per tile, warp-partitioned QK, PRMT INT8-to-FP16 conversion and FP32 PV accumulation
at the admitted three-to-five-token widths. T=1/2 and other geometries retain the prior
path. At 180,224 capacity on the 85K code prompt, the previous kernel measured
**76.25 tok/s**, 37 rounds, 82.57% draft acceptance; the selected key-split kernel
measured **90.87 tok/s**, 36 rounds, 85.85% acceptance (+19.2% committed decode
throughput). Decode seconds per round fell from 45.37 to 39.13 ms, so the gain is not
entirely explained by the acceptance change. These are two measurements per route with
zero warmups; different outputs and draft acceptance prohibit claiming token-exact parity.
The independent INT8 attention FP64 oracle and exact KV-cache tests pass at short and
85K occupied contexts. One 8K MTP3 request returned identical tokens and acceptance in
CUDA Graph and eager execution. With MTP disabled (T=1), both kernels select the old
route: 26.48 versus 26.49 tok/s and identical 128 generated IDs at 85K.

We also rejected changing long-context splits from the existing policy to 1,920 keys per
split: even though MTP3 improved from 90.87 to 92.82 tok/s on this fixture, non-MTP
decode fell from 26.48 to 18.08 tok/s. The shipped split policy is unchanged. These
numbers describe the local NVFP4 code prompt, not typical agent decode acceptance or
quality on arbitrary prompts.

## V100 Duo GSQ-RCO IQ3_S GGUF-blocks

On 2026-10-01 the public `ninfer-serve` route was also checked with the same
GSQ artifact on two V100-SXM2 16 GB cards. TP2, INT8 KV, MTP3, the optimized
draft head, CUDA Graph, 4,096-token prefill chunks, greedy sampling and two
text slots were used. Explicit Main Text KV capacities distinguish a native
262,144-token *per-request ceiling* from two independent full-context KV
entitlements:

| Per-request ceiling | Shared KV tokens | Result |
|---:|---:|---|
| 262,144 | 524,288 | Startup rejected: runtime reservation 12,063,633,152 B exceeds available 10,154,556,416 B |
| 262,144 | 262,144 | Started; 2.74 GiB free per GPU; two short requests decoded concurrently |
| 200,000 | 400,000 | Started; 811 MiB free per GPU; two short requests decoded concurrently |

To find the highest shared KV pool with the **262,144-token per-request
ceiling fixed**, the same two-slot, 4,096-chunk configuration was started
repeatedly on 2026-10-01 (one server at a time):

| Shared KV tokens | Mode | Observed result |
|---:|---|---|
| 358,016 | `auto` | Started; 1.13 GiB physically free, 1 GiB planned headroom |
| 409,600 | explicit | Started; 277 MiB physically free; two short HTTP requests each produced 128 tokens |
| 417,792 | explicit | Started; 137 MiB physically free; two short HTTP requests each produced 128 tokens |
| 417,856 | explicit | Started; 137 MiB physically free, 0.38 MiB planned slack; two short HTTP requests each produced 128 tokens |
| 417,920 | explicit | Rejected: 10,154,114,816 B reservation > 10,153,361,408 B available |

The Main pool allocates 64-token pages, so the last two explicit points are
adjacent allocation sizes. Startup budgets varied slightly between runs; the
one-page boundary is an **observed ceiling in this run**, not a stable safe
setting. At 417,856 tokens, the primary GPU had only 137 MiB free after graph
setup. Prefer `auto` for its 1 GiB sizing headroom, or leave ample explicit
margin rather than using the measured edge. Two concurrently *occupied* long
contexts were not measured.

The same hardware, artifact, TP2/MTP3/INT8 KV, 4,096-token chunk and native
262,144-token per-request ceiling were also measured at **three text slots**
on 2026-10-01. Only one server was resident at a time:

| Shared KV tokens | Mode | Result |
|---:|---|---|
| 344,256 | `auto` | Started; 1.20 GiB physically free; three 31-token prompt / 256-output requests completed in 9.62–9.78 s, with decode batches reaching size 3.00 |
| 400,000 | explicit | Started; 273 MiB free, 70.32 MiB planned slack; three 31-token prompt / 256-output requests completed in 9.64–9.79 s, with decode batches reaching size 3.00 |
| 403,968 | explicit | Started; 205 MiB free; three short requests completed |
| 404,032 | explicit | Started; 203 MiB free; three short requests completed |
| 404,096 | explicit | Started; 201 MiB free, 0.19 MiB planned slack; three short requests completed in 9.63–9.78 s, decode batches reaching size 3.00 |
| 404,160 | explicit | Rejected: 10,154,307,328 B reservation > 10,153,361,408 B available |
| 404,224 | explicit | Rejected: 10,155,456,256 B reservation > 10,154,556,416 B available |

The highest observed working pool, 404,096 tokens, and rejected adjacent
64-token page are a **run-specific memory boundary**: even the 400,000-token
explicit profile leaves only 273 MiB physically free. The `auto` capacity
retains its 1 GiB planning headroom and is the safer starting point when
the larger shared pool is unnecessary. This checks three *short* concurrent
requests, not three occupied long contexts or the exact maximum on every startup.

Vision support for this GSQ artifact was verified with the same TP2, INT8 KV,
MTP3 and three-slot configuration, using the v3 Vision tower and merger weights
projected without runtime repacking:

| Vision profile (262,144 context ceiling) | Shared KV | Startup/result |
|---|---:|---|
| `--prefill-chunk 4096 --vision-max-tokens 2048` | 400,000 | Rejected: 10,100,664,064 B runtime reservation > 9,858,836,992 B available |
| `--prefill-chunk 1024 --vision-max-tokens 2048 --kv-capacity auto` | 344,832 | Started with 1.20 GiB free per GPU and 1 GiB planned headroom; real-image checks passed |
| `--prefill-chunk 1024 --vision-max-tokens 2048 --kv-capacity 400000` | 400,000 | Started with 283 MiB free per GPU, 80.33 MiB planned slack; real-image checks passed |

For both successful profiles, `tools/v100/check_vision_http.py` passed all
six requests via public HTTP serving: red-circle and blue-square 384 × 384
images, a 1280 × 1280 image spanning prefill chunks, two images in one prompt,
and two concurrent long-form image responses. It checks scene semantics, not
pixel-level model accuracy. At 400K shared KV, three additional concurrent
real-image requests each completed a 384-token continuation and the server
recorded decode batch size **3.00**; all requests identified the depicted shape
and color correctly. This does not establish correctness or speed with three
near-full contexts occupied. The 400K setting has little startup margin; `auto`
is safer when maximum shared KV capacity is not required.

### V100 DFlash2 Op measurements (not end-to-end)

On 2026-10-01, one Tesla V100-SXM2-16GB (CUDA 12.8, `sm_70`) measured the
production public Ops using cold-cache CUDA Graph launches, 256 MiB cache flush,
30 repetitions, three requests, seven proposals per request (`W=8`, `T=24`):

| Op | Shape | Median latency |
|---|---|---:|
| candidate selector | 16 candidates, 7 steps, greedy | 89.088 µs |
| candidate selector | 16 candidates, 7 steps, stochastic | 102.400 µs |
| dynamic grouped conv prepare | 5120 hidden, 1280 BF16 control rows | 123.904 µs |
| dynamic grouped conv add | 4096 input channels, W8 | 105.472 µs |
| dynamic grouped conv add | 17408 input channels, W8 | 525.312 µs |
| symmetric SWA (TP2 rank) | 16Q/4KV, 2048 window, FP16 context V | 1,338.368 µs |
| draft QKV (TP2 rank) | W8 `[3072,5120]` → Q2048/K512/V512, T=24 | 294.912 µs |
| draft QKV (TP2 rank) | same, T=48 | 324.608 µs |
| feature projection (TP2 rank) | W8 `[5120,12800]`, T=24 | 388.096 µs |
| attention output projection (TP2 rank) | W8 `[5120,2048]`, T=24 | 58.368 µs |

Reproduction: `build-v100-duo/bench/ninfer_candidate_selector_bench --steps 7
--batch 3 --repeat 30`, `build-v100-duo/bench/ninfer_dynamic_grouped_conv_prepare_bench
--width 8 --batch 3 --repeat 30`, and
`build-v100-duo/bench/ninfer_linear_dynamic_grouped_conv_add_bench --width 8
--batch 3 --k 4096 --repeat 30` (repeat for `--k 17408`). The BF16 control
projection now reuses its weight rows across groups of eight columns rather
than using a separate matvec per column; its full numerical test passes.
The SWA value is `build-v100-duo/bench/ninfer_swa_dflash2_bench --width 8
--batch 3 --context 2048` with the same cold-cache protocol; at a 96-token
context it measures 108.544 µs and at 2048 it uses two graph nodes. A
64-way rather than 32-way KV split measured 1,388.544 µs and was discarded.
For the dedicated DFlash2 route, reducing the 2048-context split capacity
from 32 to 16 or 8 measured 1,348.608 / 1,338.368 µs (W=8/B=3), while
4 splits regressed to 1,566.720 µs. The 8-split variant measured
2,595.840 µs at W=16/B=3/context2048, 623.616 µs at
W=8/B=3/context1024, and 99.328 µs at context96. Earlier 32-split
W=16/B=3/context2048 measured 2,476.032 µs, so the 8-split
configuration is not universally faster; only W=8/B=3 selects eight splits.
The W=16/B=3 route retains 32 splits (remeasured 2,478.080 µs), and
W=8/B=1 and B=8 retain 32 splits (450.560 / 3,240.960 µs at context2048).
All choices need a full-round speed check once Program exists.
QKV values use `build-v100-duo/bench/ninfer_dflash2_tp2_attn_input_bench`
with the same cold-cache protocol; T=1/8/32 measured 45.056/106.496/347.136 µs.
T=24 uses one fused SIMT launch; T=32/48 use three section-local Tensor Core
launches. The initial all-SIMT T=48 route measured 574.464 µs and was replaced;
the three-launch Tensor Core route at T=24 measured 343.040 µs and was discarded.
These are single-rank Op results, not an inference-speed comparison.
The last two Linear values use `build-v100-duo/bench/ninfer_linear_bench
--qtype w8 --n 5120 --k 12800 --t 24 --warmup 4 --repeat 30` (change
`--k` to `2048` for attention output). Feature T=1/8/48 measured
147.456/219.136/380.928 µs; attention output T=48 measured 71.680 µs.
The benchmark prints RTX 5090 reference-bandwidth columns; only the actual
V100 device and directly measured latency are applicable here. TP2 collective
costs and the five-layer schedule are not part of these Linear measurements.
These figures do **not** include the five-layer draft, context KV, TP2
collectives, target verification, prefill, or request scheduling; they cannot
establish DFlash2-versus-MTP throughput.

The real GSQ v3 companion's 66 tensors contain 2,226,792,960 payload bytes;
its standalone TP2 shard plan places 1,307,650,560 bytes per rank, including
replicated selector codebooks required for arbitrary candidate-ID lookup.
The real two-GPU binding test also loaded complete Vision + Text + optimized
proposal + DFlash2 weights **without MTP**, checked both rank-local model views
and compared its weight-arena footprint against the identical Vision + Text +
optimized proposal + MTP profile:

| Weight arena | Rank 0 | Rank 1 |
|---|---:|---:|
| MTP selected | 6,741,169,664 B | 6,445,450,240 B |
| DFlash2 selected | 7,874,585,600 B | 7,578,866,176 B |
| Increase | 1,133,415,936 B | 1,133,415,936 B |

These are **weight-only** figures, not the memory of a running DFlash2 Engine.
DFlash2 now loads the companion and runs TP2 decode; the earlier Vision + MTP +
400K KV profile (283 MiB free per rank) is **not** a DFlash2 memory profile and
must not be reused without a separate capacity measurement.

#### DFlash2 versus MTP3: one-request decode

Measured October 2, 2026 on 2 × V100-SXM2 16 GB, CUDA 12.8, GSQ-RCO IQ3_S v3,
TP2, INT8 KV, CUDA Graph, optimized proposal head, 2304 max context and 256
prefill chunk. The same counting-prompt fixture produces 128 output tokens,
including one prefill token; the reported decode interval measures 127 output
tokens. The independent three-repetition unprofiled probe yields **96.4 tok/s
for MTP3** and **43.7 tok/s for DFlash2-K7**. The single-request probes below
measure `GenerationTimings.decode_seconds` and report the corresponding
accepted-draft counts; Nsight tracing perturbs elapsed time, so their rates are
diagnostic rather than the published steady-state comparison.

| Graph route | Decode seconds, 127 tokens | Rounds | Accepted / drafted | First position accepted / rounds |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| MTP3 | 1.318 | 42 | 85 / 125 | 40 / 42 |
| DFlash2-K1 | 2.789 | 81 | 45 / 81 | 45 / 81 |
| DFlash2-K3 | 2.534 | 67 | 59 / 201 | 38 / 67 |
| DFlash2-K7 | 2.911 (traced) | 59 | 68 / 396 | not recorded |
| DFlash2-K15 | 4.305 (traced) | 49 | 78 / 677 | not recorded |

The bottleneck is **both** acceptance and cost per round. K3 requires 67
target verify rounds versus MTP3's 42, while its mean decode round takes
about 37.8 ms versus MTP3's 31.4 ms. Position one is accepted in 38/67 DFlash2
rounds versus 40/42 MTP rounds; widening the block leaves much of its target
verification and five-layer draft computation unused after early rejection.
Nsight Systems node-level tracing of K3 shows the global top-16 kernel at
approximately 3.67 ms per rank per round (136 calls across two devices) and
many GGUF small-column vector kernels in the five-layer draft and target.
These GPU kernel sums include both ranks and cannot be added to get wall time.
No measured DFlash2 speedup over MTP is established. The scope here is one
short counting prompt, not general model quality or three-request throughput.

On October 2, 2026, a 1024-row tiled, parallel-reduction top-16 implementation
passed the independent `ninfer_linear_topk_test` and the real Engine K15/B3
Graph + Vision regression. On the same artifact and K3/B1 Graph fixture, its
single 127-token decode interval was **2.292 s** (67 rounds, 59/201 accepted),
down from 2.534 s before this change. A separate three-repetition, unprofiled
decode-only comparison measured **55.45 tok/s for DFlash2-K3** and **96.36 tok/s
for MTP3**. These are different K settings from the earlier K7 comparison; the
older table and kernel trace describe the pre-optimization implementation.
The improvement does not overcome the lower DFlash2 acceptance or other
per-round costs; it establishes no DFlash2 speed advantage over MTP3.

On October 2, 2026, a separate unprofiled B=3 probe on the same two V100-SXM2
16 GB GPUs, CUDA 12.8 and GSQ v3 artifact used INT8 KV, Graph, the optimized
proposal head, a 2304-token per-request context and three repetitions of three
simultaneously submitted 128-output-token requests. Wall-clock aggregate output
rates were **66.12 tok/s for DFlash2-K3** (612 request-rounds, 522/1836 accepted
drafts) and **21.57 tok/s for DFlash2-K7** (519 request-rounds, 615/3543
accepted drafts). These rates include request submission and prefill, unlike
the B=1 decode-only comparison; K7 saves rounds but pays substantially more
per round on this workload. The planned paired B=3 MTP3 Graph control did not
start: its Graph preparation consumed 41,943,040 bytes on device 0 against a
37,748,736-byte planned allowance. Consequently this B=3 probe compares K3
and K7 only; it establishes neither a B=3 DFlash2-versus-MTP3 ratio nor
general behavior on longer prompts or contexts.

#### NVFP4 companion: one-request DFlash2 versus ordinary and MTP3

Measured October 2, 2026 on 2 × V100-SXM2 16 GB, CUDA 12.8, the explicit
`/home/gareth/models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer` v3 artifact with its embedded
DFlash2 companion, TP2, INT8 KV, Graph, optimized proposal head, 2304 max
context, 256 prefill chunk and the same counting-prompt fixture. Each route
warmed up for 16 tokens and generated 128 output tokens three times; rates
count only the 127-token decode interval per repetition, not loading or prefill.
The real Engine test also compared the 24-token greedy DFlash2 result to the
ordinary route and exercised B1 integration state/reuse checks.

| Route | Three-repeat decode tok/s | Versus ordinary | Versus MTP3 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Ordinary (no speculation) | 42.20–42.21 | 1.00× | 0.34× |
| DFlash2-K3 | 69.81 | **1.65×** | 0.57× |
| DFlash2-K7 | 68.26 | **1.62×** | 0.56× |
| MTP3 | 122.45–122.48 | **2.90×** | 1.00× |

NVFP4 thus delivers a real DFlash2 gain over ordinary decode on this fixture,
but K3 and K7 remain slower than MTP3. K7 does not recover the difference.
This is a short greedy B1 result, not a long-context or concurrent-service
speed claim. Unlike GSQ's GGUF output head, the NVFP4 artifact's optimized
proposal uses Q4G64; the current TP2 DFlash2 top-16 path only supports that
optimized head for this profile, not its FP8 full vocabulary head. Its DFlash2
companion matrices remain W8, not NVFP4.

On the same dual-V100 GSQ v3 counting-prompt fixture, a further unprofiled
three-repetition, 127-token decode-only sweep of startup-fixed K=1,2,3 with
Graph, B1, optimized head and INT8 target KV measured **51.19 / 55.01 /
55.42 tok/s**, respectively; the paired MTP3 controls were 96.32 / 96.37 /
96.40 tok/s. The real Engine integration checks passed for all three K.
Reducing draft width to one or two does not improve this one-request workload
over K3, so merely shortening the five-layer proposal is not a demonstrated
remedy for its end-to-end throughput. The earlier traced K3 run attributes
roughly 3.16 s summed across both devices to 51,682 GGUF vector launches;
that sum is not elapsed wall time or an isolated draft cost. Further GGUF
kernel changes need a matched whole-inference speed measurement, not just a
single-Op microbenchmark.

On the same 2 × V100-SXM2 16 GB / CUDA 12.8 GSQ v3 artifact and K3/B1 Graph
counting-prompt fixture, a specialized Q4_K A16 vector route uses two warps
instead of four for vocabulary-height segments with 2–4 columns; other GGUF
formats and the A8 route retain their existing dispatch. At the Q4_K
`[124160,5120]` TP2 output-head benchmark shape and T=4, A16 projection
fell from **1978.42 to 1487.51 µs** (one-rank Op timing); the neighboring
IQ3_S `[17408,5120]` T=4 A8 path measured 141.41 / 141.77 µs.
Independent stored-block decode with an FP64 dot oracle on the actual
`[65536,5120]` optimized-head shard at T=2/3/4 passed, as did the real
K3/B3 Graph + Vision integration check. Same-command three-repetition
unprofiled K3/B1 decode-only measurements were **55.4185 before** and
**57.0249 tok/s after**, with MTP3 controls of 96.3662 and 98.3277 tok/s.
Both routes sped up in the latter session; the ~2.9% raw DFlash2 change is
not wholly attributable to the kernel. The ratio to the MTP3 control moved
from 0.5751 to 0.5799, or roughly 0.8% relative. This is a small
workload-specific improvement, not a general DFlash2-versus-MTP advantage;
larger or long-context workloads need their own verification.

Further one-rank Q4_K A16 T4 launch-geometry controls on the same V100 used
2 warps × 8 rows (1570.00 µs) and 1 warp × 4 rows (1389.67 µs), versus
the retained 2 warps × 4 rows (1487.51 µs). The 2 × 8 variant was discarded.
The 1 × 4 variant keeps the stored-block decode and arithmetic unchanged;
the independent FP64 GGUF oracle passes at the real `[65536,5120]` optimized
head shape for T=2/3/4, and K3/B3 Graph + Vision passes. An unprofiled
K3/B1 three-repeat decode-only run measured 57.3214 tok/s versus 57.0249
tok/s for the earlier 2 × 4 route, with paired MTP3 controls of 98.6012
and 98.3277 tok/s, respectively. The relative-control difference is under
0.3%; no robust inference-speed improvement over the 2 × 4 route is
established from these sessions, despite the reproducible Op improvement.
Holding the 1 × 4 launch fixed and prefetching four Q4_K blocks per stage
instead of two measured **1703.32 µs** at the same T4 head shape; it was
rejected and the two-block code restored. A rebuild and `ninfer_gguf_test`
passed after the restore. This Op result does not justify another full decode
speed claim.
Reading Q4_K blocks directly from global memory instead of the shared-memory
weight stage also lost at the same T4 head shape (1554.59 µs versus
1389.67 µs with staging), so that experiment was removed as well.

A same-prompt K3/B1 Graph control with the **full** proposal head produced
55/212 accepted drafts in 71 rounds, with 37/71 at position one; its
127-token decode interval was 2.497 s. The optimized head produced 59/201 in
67 rounds, with 38/67 at position one (2.292 s). Thus removing the 131072-row
shortlist does not recover the missing first-position acceptance on this
fixture; the head also costs more to evaluate. This comparison does not
establish why the draft disagrees with the target.

Nsight Systems node traces on the optimized-head K3 route show the tiled
top-16 kernel falling from 3.663 ms to 0.057 ms per rank call; the new finish
stage adds 0.019 ms per rank call. Across both GPUs and 67 rounds, the sum of
top-16 GPU-kernel durations falls from 499.6 to 11.8 ms. The sum of GGUF
vector-kernel durations remains about 3.16 s across 51,682 launches in both
traces. GPU sums from two cards are **not** wall time and must not be read as
the elapsed cost of an isolated stage; the unprofiled 55.45 tok/s comparison
above establishes the end-to-end result. The five-layer draft has no
independent real-checkpoint numerical oracle yet, so low acceptance cannot
be assigned to model quality, quantization, or a specific implementation error.

Additional same-prompt controls after the top-16 change (single 127-token
decode, K3/B1 Graph) give 70 rounds and 56/210 accepted drafts with BF16
target KV, versus 67 rounds and 59/201 with INT8 target KV; first-position
acceptance was 38 rounds in either case. These are separate generated
trajectories, not matched-token numerical comparisons. An INT8-KV K7 run
needed 58 rounds and accepted 68/396 drafts, with per-position acceptances
`34,14,5,5,4,3,3`: the extra positions save nine verify rounds relative to
K3, but add five-layer draft and target verification work every round. Its
single decode interval was 2.702 s under the profiling fixture, versus
2.292 s for K3. Neither changing KV storage nor increasing K establishes
the cause of the low first-position acceptance.

The artifact's conversion report records 21 DFlash2 `q8_g32_fp16`
`grouped_absmax` matrices derived from the companion checkpoint and 45
direct BF16 companion objects. The target Text GGUF matrices retain their
mixed IQ/GGUF formats. Compared with a BF16-companion/BF16-target run this
is a distinct numerical pairing; it is a plausible source of lower draft
agreement, **not** a demonstrated cause. The original BF16 companion files
are not available on this host, and no matched-input, layer-by-layer
real-checkpoint oracle has been run. Do not attribute a correctness bug or
quantization loss from the acceptance figures alone.

The same K3/INT8-KV optimized-head fixture run **eager** instead of Graph
gave 68 rounds, 58/204 accepted drafts and 37/68 first-position accepts
(2.301 s); Graph gave 67 rounds, 59/201 and 38/67 (2.292 s). These are
separate trajectories; the similar result is evidence against a Graph-only
acceptance regression, not a per-token Graph/eager equivalence proof.

For an unprofiled three-repetition K7/B1 Graph decode-only comparison after
the top-16 change, the same 127-token counting-prompt fixture measured
**47.05 tok/s DFlash2-K7** versus **96.30 tok/s MTP3**. The K3 result above
is therefore faster than K7 on this fixture even after removing the earlier
top-16 bottleneck; K7's extra verify/draft columns do not pay for themselves.

With the opt-in `NINFER_DFLASH2_INSPECT_FIRST=1` readback on the same K3/B1
Graph INT8-KV counting prompt, excluding the four warmup rounds leaves 67
measured rounds. The target first-position greedy argmax appears in the
draft's unary top-16 on **62/67** rounds; the selector chooses it on **38/67**.
Of the 29 first-position misses, **24** have the target token in the top-16,
and **5** do not. Target argmax is the highest unary-score candidate in 32
rounds; the selector chooses that token on all 32 and adds six successful
non-top-1 choices. Thus simply replacing the selector with unary top-1 would
reduce, not improve, first-position matches on this trajectory. The 24
in-support misses motivate comparing edge scores and target preferences on
the **same hidden states**; top-16 membership alone is not an oracle for
which path the companion ought to prefer. This is one greedy counting prompt,
not an acceptance estimate for other workloads. Device readback is diagnostic
only and is excluded from the throughput numbers.

An additional **eager** K3/B1 run on the same counting prompt enabled both
`NINFER_DFLASH2_INSPECT_FIRST=1` and `NINFER_DFLASH2_INSPECT_EDGE=1`.
Excluding its four warmup rounds leaves 68 rounds, 58/204 accepted drafts,
37/68 first-position matches, and 63/68 first-position target tokens in the
unary top-16. For every measured round, a CPU FP64 sum of the stored BF16
predecessor codebook, projected hidden, and successor codebook, added to the
emitted FP32 unary score, selected the **same first token** as the GPU
selector (68/68). In the 26 in-support first-position misses, the selected
token's recomputed edge exceeded the target token's edge by 0.0614 / 1.3797 /
6.9768 (minimum / median / maximum), whereas the BF16 target logit favored
the target token by 3.375 / 5.125 / 30.125. This argues against a gross
candidate-ID, codebook orientation, or first-position selector-reduction
error; it does **not** independently validate the draft's five-layer hidden,
W8 companion weights, or agreement with a BF16 companion. The eager and Graph
runs are separate generated trajectories, and both diagnostics synchronize
and read device data: their elapsed times are not speed measurements. The
next numerical question is whether the draft hidden and unary logits agree
with an independent companion calculation on matched features; no original
BF16 companion checkpoint is present locally.

As a **recorded-first-position counterfactual only**, multiplying the
reconstructed edge interaction by 2 instead of 1 selects the target greedy
argmax on 42/68 rather than 37/68 counting-prompt rounds. A separate eager
K3/B1 128-output run with the fixed prompt “Write a short story about a
lighthouse keeper on a stormy night.” had 64 measured rounds after six warmup
rounds, 63/191 accepted drafts and 37/64 first-position matches; the target
was in the unary top-16 on 60/64, and the CPU recomputation reproduced the
GPU first choice on all 64. On those recorded rows, doubling the interaction
still matches only 37/64, while unary-only matches 40/64. These are
**different prompts** and fixed-prefix what-ifs: changing an earlier draft
would change later states and verification, so none of these counts predicts
end-to-end acceptance or speed. The opposite directions rule out adopting a
global edge multiplier from this small sample; 1Cat-vLLM's selector-alignment
study similarly separates candidate support from actual proposal/target
overlap rather than treating an in-sample argmax sweep as a speed result.

A separate English lighthouse-story prompt (same artifact, K3/B1 Graph,
INT8 KV, 128 generated tokens) produced 55 measured rounds after its
six-round warmup, with 72/165 accepted drafts and 32/55 first-position
accepts. The first target argmax was in the unary top-16 on **51/55** rounds;
**19** first-position misses had it in support and **4** did not. The target
argmax was unary rank zero in 32 rounds, while the selector gained one
non-rank-zero match and lost one rank-zero match. These diagnostics show the
same broad in-support disagreement on a second prompt, not that changing the
selector would improve acceptance; both traces read back GPU tensors and
their elapsed times are not throughput comparisons.

An HTTP request for a long story, with thinking disabled and 513 output
tokens, used a 40-token prompt. After one warmup, the 200K/two-entitlement
profile completed one request in 6.965 s (73.66 aggregate output tok/s) and
two pairs in 10.327 / 10.032 s (99.35 / 102.27 aggregate output tok/s).
The native-262K/shared-one-entitlement profile completed two pairs in
10.666 / 10.023 s (96.20 / 102.36 aggregate output tok/s). Each response
finished at the output limit; server throughput records reached average decode
batch size 2.00. Prefix reuse was enabled, so these rates include possible
cached prompt prefixes and are not controlled cold-prefill measurements.
No 200K- or 262K-occupied concurrent prefill was run: memory admission and
short-request batching do not establish long-context performance or completion
at the full frontier. The startup failures do not establish the exact maximum
feasible two-entitlement ceiling between 200K and 262K.

On 2026-10-01, the same **2 × V100-SXM2 16 GB** NVLink host, CUDA 12.8, and
branch `feat/gguf-blocks-v100` measured `out/Qwen3.8-27B-GSQ-RCO-IQ3_S-ninfer-v3.ninfer`
(identity `qwen3.8-27b/gguf-blocks`, 12.0 GiB uploaded, 5.66 GiB per GPU) with
TP2, INT8 KV, 262,144-token capacity, 4,096-token chunks, MTP3 with the
optimized proposal head, CUDA Graph and greedy sampling. Prompts are
`ninfer_v100_corpus --code-chat` code prompts; each point is two cold requests
with one prefill token and 1,024 measured decode tokens and model stops
disabled, so these are fixed-output speed measurements, not answer quality.

| Occupied prompt | TTFT mean | Prefill tok/s | Decode tok/s (mean ± sd) | MTP accepted |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 30,000 | 17.90 s | 1,676 | 98.88 ± 0.00 | 80.3% |
| 100,000 | 79.34 s | 1,260 | 76.19 ± 0.03 | 73.7% |
| 150,000 | 144.97 s | 1,035 | 70.24 ± 0.14 | 78.1% |
| 250,000 | 341.33 s | 734 | 57.84 ± 0.07 | 79.6% |

The official NVFP4 artifact on the same build (180,224-token capacity,
otherwise identical) measured 30K 1,054 / 115.88, 100K 873 / 82.98 and 150K
763 / 77.14 prefill / decode tok/s.

Decode progression at 30K on this branch (same prompt; tok/s; acceptance
moves only when output tokens change):

| Change | Decode | MTP accepted | Output vs previous |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| First version (FP32 GEMV, byte loads) | 67.20 | 77.7% | — |
| Shared-memory weight stages, 4 rows/warp | 70.64 | 77.7% | identical |
| int8 activations (`AllowA8`, dp4a) | 85.72 | 80.3% | differs |
| 2 rows/warp for 2–4 columns | 88.19 | 80.3% | identical |
| i-quant codebooks in shared memory | 89.95 | 80.3% | identical |
| One-shot NVLink all-reduce | 98.88 | 80.3% | identical |

At 30K the 1,024-token window costs about 17.3 ms per MTP round. An nsys
trace before the all-reduce change showed ~75% of GPU time in the 4-column
GGUF projections (190–360 GB/s against roughly 800 GB/s achievable) and ~15%
idle in cross-device event waits; the one-shot all-reduce
(`src/ops/common/allreduce.cu`) removed most of the latter. Prefill at 16K is
61% CUTLASS FP16 GEMM, 16% GDN and 8% attention. Rejected variants: deeper
weight stages (4 and 6 blocks per row) and a 32-value-per-lane sub-block
kernel were slower end to end; MTP4/MTP5 measured 81.42 / 65.28 tok/s at 30K
because acceptance falls to 73% / 53%.

Verification: `ninfer_gguf_test` (FP64 decode of all ten formats; A16, A8 and
tensor-core routes at real fused and TP2 shapes; GDN output permutation),
`ninfer_allreduce_test` (both routes, 64 chained rounds), and an
`ninfer-serve` chat completion with thinking enabled. Reproduce:

## V100 Duo October 2026 rebuild: two-artifact comparison

October 2, 2026: `cmake --build build-v100-duo -j` completed (381 actions) on
2 × V100-SXM2 16 GB, CUDA 12.8. The explicit artifacts were
`/home/gareth/models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer` and
`out/Qwen3.8-27B-GSQ-RCO-IQ3_S-ninfer-v3.ninfer`. This is a **same-build,
cross-artifact** comparison after the DFlash2 reader/runtime additions; no
pre-change binary was retained for a matched old/new regression measurement.
Do not interpret a difference from an older table as a causal effect of these
changes. Both artifacts' Text/MTP paths run with DFlash2 residency **off**.
The rebuilt artifact-reader test checked both artifact projections; the real
DFlash2 K3/B1/Graph/INT8 Engine integration test passed on **each** artifact.

Selected MTP3 production-server startup checks after the rebuild (CUDA Graph,
TP2, INT8 KV, 2 × 16 GB; reported `free-after-startup` is the primary GPU):

| Artifact / profile | Shared KV resolved | Primary free | Scope |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| NVFP4, Vision, C2, 155,648 max context, 1,024 chunk, 2,048 visual budget | 155,648 | 713 MiB | Started; not a new full-context image decode test |
| NVFP4, text, C1, 200,000 max context, 1,024 chunk | 200,000 | 153 MiB | Near-OOM startup boundary; not a serving recommendation |
| GSQ-RCO, Vision, C3, native 262,144 max context, 1,024 chunk, 2,048 visual budget, KV auto | 344,832 | 1.20 GiB | Started; not a three-full-context qualification |

Earlier real-image and concurrent request checks are in the
[Vision](#v100-duo-vision-and-concurrency) and
[GSQ](#v100-duo-gsq-rco-iq3_s-gguf-blocks) sections; these three new startup
checks do not repeat them or prove end-to-end speed for those profiles.

### Matched code prompts

`ninfer_v100_corpus --code-chat` rendered the same 512, 10,000 and 30,000
token tasks with each artifact's tokenizer; the paired `.ids` files matched
byte for byte. Each point used the public `ninfer_bench` Engine, TP2, INT8 KV,
CUDA Graph, optimized MTP3, 131,072 max context, 4,096 prefill chunk,
`-pg LENGTH,512 --warmup 0 -r 2`, two independent requests without prompt
reuse and 512 measured decode outputs after the prefill token. A graph-prime
request precedes the measured requests. Rates are the benchmark's two-rep
arithmetic means; model load and graph preparation are excluded. The benchmark
disables default stops and does not judge answer quality.

| Model | Prompt | Prefill tok/s | Decode tok/s |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| NVFP4 | 512 | 878.00 | 128.60 |
| GSQ-RCO | 512 | 1,358.11 | 110.03 |
| NVFP4 | 10,000 | 1,123.35 | 120.12 |
| GSQ-RCO | 10,000 | 1,857.14 | 107.61 |
| NVFP4 | 30,000 | 1,061.93 | 119.22 |
| GSQ-RCO | 30,000 | 1,683.49 | 104.55 |

### First SDK request capture

The local-only capture harness (`tools/v100/agent_prefill/capture.mjs`) captured
first-turn Pi, Codex and Claude Agent SDK payloads, without forwarding to a
model service. Each artifact's tokenizer generated the same IDs for each
captured prompt: 1,298, 11,720 and 16,368 tokens respectively. The Codex
capture differs by two tokens from the older September capture. Run the public
benchmark with the same 131,072-context configuration, `-pg TOKENS,8
--warmup 0 -r 1`; the measured request has no previous prefix reuse. TTFT
is `reps[0].timings.first_token_seconds`: first Engine output token, excluding
load, SDK startup, network and any Agent tool actions.

| Model | Agent | TTFT s | Prefill tok/s |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| NVFP4 | Pi | 1.248 | 1,040.13 |
| GSQ-RCO | Pi | 0.912 | 1,423.59 |
| NVFP4 | Codex | 10.452 | 1,121.37 |
| GSQ-RCO | Codex | 6.213 | 1,886.42 |
| NVFP4 | Claude | 14.759 | 1,109.08 |
| GSQ-RCO | Claude | 8.978 | 1,823.25 |

### Natural-completion MTP sweep

`tools/v100/ninfer-v100-duo.sh` ran one resident server per model/window with
`--max-context 131072 --prefill-chunk 4096 --no-thinking --no-prefix-reuse`,
optimized proposal, Graph, TP2, INT8 KV and MTP `draft-tokens=3|4|5`.
Each server handled three identical single-user Chat Completions requests:
the 74-token pelican/SVG/HTML prompt in [the earlier sweep](#v100-duo-decode-pelican-html),
`reasoning_effort:none`, `temperature:0`, `seed:42`, `max_tokens:12288`.
All 18 responses ended with a stop token and had zero prefix-cache hits.
The peak is the highest 5-second logged decode throughput interval with one
running request, not a whole-request maximum. The average is the arithmetic
mean of the three `(completion_tokens - 1) / timings_seconds.decode` rates;
both exclude load and prefill. Different models/windows produce *different
completions*, so this is not a fixed-output speed or quality comparison.

| Model | MTP | Output tokens per run | Peak 5-second tok/s | Mean whole-request tok/s |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| NVFP4 | 3 | 9,668 | 148.2 | 138.058 |
| NVFP4 | 4 | 9,324 | 156.4 | 142.871 |
| NVFP4 | 5 | 9,881 | 176.0 | 151.448 |
| GSQ-RCO | 3 | 6,986 | 121.0 | 109.607 |
| GSQ-RCO | 4 | 5,887 | 110.4 | 95.164 |
| GSQ-RCO | 5 | 6,531 | 119.6 | 93.754 |
| Swift-1.5 | 3 | 7,995 | 153.4 | 143.128 |
| Swift-1.5 | 4 | 8,830 | 176.2 | 157.830 |
| Swift-1.5 | 5 | 7,778 | 183.6 | 163.134 |

For NVFP4, MTP5 increases this prompt's mean but the older output inspection
favored MTP3 for the requested pelican leg animation. GSQ favors MTP3 by
mean; GSQ-MTP5's three full-request rates ranged 86.798–97.260 tok/s, so
its mean is less stable than the other rows. No independent output-quality
judgment was made for the new GSQ responses. To reproduce the server sweep,
replace the artifact path and window `N` in the command under
[V100 Duo decode: pelican HTML](#v100-duo-decode-pelican-html), adding
`--max-context 131072 --prefill-chunk 4096`; use the same JSON request and
extract `request_done` timings and five-second throughput intervals as there.

The Swift-1.5 rows were measured October 5, 2026 with the same
`build-v100-duo` binary, flags, request and three-runs-per-window protocol,
using `/home/gareth/models/swift-1.5-qwen3.8-27b-orcarouter-dflash2-nvfp4.ninfer`
(`kvnxiao/swift-1.5-qwen3.8-27b-orcarouter-dflash2-nvfp4-ninfer` on Hugging
Face), a third-party OracleRouter fine-tune that loads as the same
`qwen3.8-27b/nvfp4` target. Its nine responses all ended with a stop token
with zero prefix-cache hits, and each window's three completions were
identical: 7,995, 8,830 and 7,778 output tokens with per-run full-request
rates of 143.118–143.145, 157.782–157.860 and 163.128–163.146 tok/s. It leads
both registered artifacts in every window of this prompt, but it is a
different model with different completion lengths and no output-quality
inspection, so these rows remain same-prompt throughput rather than a
quality or fixed-output comparison. Reproduce with the same command and the
artifact path swapped.

## V100 Duo maximum-context capacity sweep

The capacity comparison in the README varies only the requested maximum context from 1,024
through 65,536 tokens, doubling at each step. Every request uses the same 512-token code-chat
prompt and generates 257 tokens: one from prefill and 256 in the measured decode interval.
It measures the effect of the capacity setting, not inference with that many occupied tokens.

Each engine starts with a fresh resident model at each capacity, discards one complete warmup
request, and measures three complete requests with prompt-cache reuse disabled. Both consume
the exact saved prompt IDs, use greedy sampling, and retain their configured MTP3 policies.
NInfer uses TP2, INT8 group-64 KV, CUDA Graphs and the optimized proposal head; LM Studio uses
backend 2.33.0, automatic GPU splitting, Q8 KV and maximum-three/minimum-zero MTP as above.
Rates exclude the first token and loading time. The tool rejects EOS/EOG, incomplete windows,
truncated input and unexpected LM prompt-cache reuse. Reported deviations are sample standard
deviations across three repetitions.

Reproduce the prompt and comparison using the existing artifact and Python 3.11 environment:

```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD/build/_deps/install/lib:/usr/local/cuda-12.8/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}" \
build-v100-duo/bench/ninfer_v100_corpus \
  /Models/NInfer-V100-Duo/qwen3_8_27b_q4_k_m.ninfer \
  /tmp/v100-code-512.ids --code-chat 512 --output-tokens 1024 \

.venv/bin/python3 tools/v100/bench_capacity.py \
  --corpus /tmp/v100-code-512.ids --output-dir /tmp/v100-capacity
```

The runner executes the engines sequentially and stops only its own temporary LM server.
Its output directory contains raw JSON responses, engine logs, requested and actual capacities,
per-repetition timings, MTP counts, and `summary.json` / `summary.md`. The `--engine ninfer`
and `--engine llama` options allow running the two sides separately in that same directory.

## V100 Duo prefix cache

The same two V100-SXM2 16 GB cards and GGUF-derived Qwen3.8-27B Q4_K_M artifact support
retained-prefix reuse with TP2 and optimized MTP3. The real-model gate uses INT8 group-64 KV,
4,096-token capacity, 256-token prefill chunks, greedy sampling and 32 output tokens. A rendered
code prompt contains 3,274 tokens; `preserve_thinking=true` saves its complete response boundary.

Three warmed cold/cache pairs measured median Engine time to first token of **11.9119 s cold**
and **0.0173602 s cached** (686×). Model loading, prompt rendering and HTTP transport are excluded.
Diagnostic logit/peer copies are disabled for these pairs. Cached requests report 3,274 reused
tokens and zero computed prefill tokens. Two exact-history follow-up turns each prefill only 30
tokens, with roughly 0.20 s time to first token. These are prompt-work savings, not a decode-rate
increase or a cache-enabled comparison against LM Studio.

The gate covers response-checkpoint replay, repeated append, zero-suffix sampling, changed-prefix
reset, rewritten response suffixes and stopping inside an accepted MTP round before continuing.
Repeated checkpoint execution, direct continuation versus checkpoint restore with identical
prefill partitions, and CUDA Graph versus eager execution must agree exactly in generated tokens,
captured logits and MTP acceptance. Both ranks' speculative egress must agree.

Cold re-prefill uses a different BF16 GEMM/GDN partition from retained decode and suffix state.
Two cold comparisons first diverged after 26 and 25 identical output tokens respectively; at each
shared history, a fresh single-output target evaluation assigned the cached choice exactly the
same logit as its selected winner (deficit 0). The test checks this first divergence against the
existing TP2 0.5-logit near-tie bound; it does not claim bit-identical free-running output across
different prefill partitions. Other cold output comparisons remain exact.

Reproduce the Engine gate and the actual HTTP turn/response-checkpoint smoke with the existing
artifact:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD/build/_deps/install/lib:/usr/local/cuda-12.8/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
NINFER_V100_DUO_ARTIFACT=/Models/NInfer-V100-Duo/qwen3_8_27b_q4_k_m.ninfer \
  build-v100-duo/tests/ninfer_qwen3_8_27b_v100-duo_prefix_real_test

.venv/bin/python3 tools/smoke/serve_thinking_preservation.py \
  --artifact /Models/NInfer-V100-Duo/qwen3_8_27b_q4_k_m.ninfer \
  --server-bin build-v100-duo/apps/ninfer-serve --backend mtp \
  --tp 2 --devices 0,1 --kv-dtype int8
```

The HTTP smoke uses a temporary local server with a 1,024-token capacity and 128-token chunks.
The cache remains process-local and can resume only the current frontier or its saved complete
turn/response checkpoint; see [serving cache behavior](serving.md#execution-behavior).

## V100 Duo context tier (host RAM + NVMe)

Retained (idle) conversations are parked instead of discarded. A lane evicted from the paged KV pool
is mirrored into pinned host RAM, and every parked lane is also published to a content-addressed NVMe
store, so restoring a prefix is a transfer rather than a re-prefill. The contract, the identity
model and the eviction-integrity rules are in
[context tiering](maintainer/context-tiering.md).

Same two V100-SXM2 16 GB cards, 27B NVFP4 artifact, TP2, optimized MTP3, INT8 group-64 KV,
4,096-token capacity, 256-token chunks, greedy sampling, 8 output tokens. The primitives, at the
registered 27B text-KV geometry (128 pages = 132 MiB of one device's Main Text KV; the GDN linear
state is 146.8 MiB per rank):

| operation | bytes | time | rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| host KV park (D2H, one device) | 132 MiB | 42.1 ms | 3.14 GB/s |
| host KV restore (H2D, one device) | 132 MiB | 82.8 ms for two of them | 3.19 GB/s |
| GDN linear state park (D2H) | 146.8 MiB | 46.7 ms | 3.14 GB/s |

Those rates sit at these cards' PCIe Gen3 ceiling, so the tier's cost is bytes over bandwidth and
nothing else.

End to end on the real artifact, 1,943-token prefixes in a two-lane pool with
`host_context_bytes=256 MiB`:

| path | ttft | computed prefill tokens |
|---|---:|---:|
| cold prefill (two lanes prefilling together) | 2.92 s / 5.91 s | 1,943 |
| resumed from NVMe, engine destroyed in between | 0.124 s / 0.193 s | **0** |

The resumed continuation is greedy-identical to the cold run. The NVMe leg deliberately destroys the
engine first, so those 0.124 s/0.193 s cannot be a host-tier hit: the host arena, the device pages,
the parked images and the resident prefix metadata are all gone, and the two prefixes are re-derived
from `disk_kv_path` by content. The cold reference prefilled under contention with its sibling lane,
so the 24x/31x ratios understate a lone resume.

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD/build/_deps/install/lib:/usr/local/cuda-12.8/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
NINFER_TEST_TP2=1 NINFER_QWEN3_6_27B_NVFP4_WEIGHTS=/path/to/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  build-v100-test/tests/ninfer_qwen3_6_27b_host_tier_real_test
NINFER_TEST_TP2=1 NINFER_QWEN3_6_27B_NVFP4_WEIGHTS=/path/to/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  build-v100-test/tests/ninfer_qwen3_6_27b_disk_tier_real_test   # scratch dir must not be tmpfs
```

At the product shape -- eight 150K-token sessions against a pool that holds one of them -- the same
gate scales up (`ninfer_qwen3_6_27b_disk_pool_real_test`, 8 x 150,022 tokens, 153,600-token
capacity, 96 GiB tier, 8 output tokens, ~40 min):

| path | ttft | computed prefill tokens | NVMe per session |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| cold prefill, one session at a time | 207.5-227.7 s | 150,022 | -- |
| resumed from NVMe, engine destroyed in between | 6.0-8.0 s | **0** | 5,462 MiB |

All eight continuations are greedy-identical to their cold runs, and the engine is destroyed before
the resumes, so nothing but the NVMe record can answer them: 8 x 5,462 MiB = 42.7 GiB on the tier,
unchanged across the reopen, `disk_tier_restores == 8`. The host tier stays empty in this shape -- one
150K lane is all the device holds, so a new session is admitted straight into that lane and its
predecessor is spilled to NVMe before its pages are reclaimed (see context tiering section 0.5).

```bash
NINFER_TEST_TP2=1 NINFER_QWEN3_6_27B_NVFP4_WEIGHTS=/path/to/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  build-v100-test/tests/ninfer_qwen3_6_27b_disk_pool_real_test   # 8 x 150K by default
NINFER_DISK_POOL_LANES=3 NINFER_DISK_POOL_TOKENS=1500 NINFER_DISK_POOL_CAPACITY=4096 \
  NINFER_DISK_POOL_DISK_BYTES=8589934592 \
  build-v100-test/tests/ninfer_qwen3_6_27b_disk_pool_real_test   # same shape, seconds
```

One host park/restore round trip of the whole lane (KV, both ranks' GDN state and the hidden rows) is
379,142,144 B at this prefix length; the parked bytes return exactly to their previous value after a
second cycle, which is what proves the arena extents are reused rather than leaked.

Both tiers are reachable only through the C++ API today (`EngineOptions::host_context_bytes`,
`disk_kv_path`, `disk_kv_bytes`); `ninfer-serve` and the CLI do not expose them yet. The host arena
itself does not reclaim, so when it is full a lane parks on NVMe instead — a slower resume, never a
re-prefill.

The Qwen3.6 measurements characterize its three registered artifact profiles independently on one
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090. They cover long-context prefill and baseline decode with speculative
decoding disabled, plus long-reasoning and cross-scenario decode with MTP and DFlash. The Qwen3.6
concurrent decode-saturation campaign measures all three profiles at C=1, 2, 4, and 8. The
Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4 campaign covers the MTP0 long-context profile and the complete MTP3
speculative-decode corpus at C=1, 2, 4, and 8; its C=1 point also supplies the single-request MTP3
results below. The registered Qwen3.8-27B `groupwise-int` profile remains outside the published
benchmark campaign.

Every inherited campaign is single-GPU except **Dual-GPU (TP2) and YaRN 1M context**, which
is measured across two RTX 5090s and under a power limit the single-GPU campaigns were not; the two
sets are not comparable to each other.

The single-request corpus requests were submitted serially to a persistent `ninfer-serve` process
over the loopback OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoint. Each reported corpus fixture used five fixed
seeds. Values are arithmetic mean ± sample standard deviation, and server warm-up completes before
the measured requests. The concurrent campaign has its own sustained-wave method below.

## Single-request serving performance method

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| GPU | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, 32 GiB |
| CUDA compile/runtime | 13.1 / 13.1 |
| CUDA driver API | 13.3 for NVFP4 and refreshed 35B MTP3; 13.1 for the remaining single-request campaigns |
| Request mode | One active request, `stream=false` |
| Maximum context | 262,144 tokens; 131,072 for refreshed NVFP4 MTP3 |
| Prefill chunk | 1,024 tokens |
| KV cache | INT8 group-64 |
| CUDA Graph | Enabled |
| Prefix reuse | Disabled |
| Sampling | Temperature 0.6, top-p 0.95, top-k 20, presence penalty 1.0 |
| Greedy profile | Exact argmax (`--sampling greedy` in the corpus runner) |
| MTP0 | no `--spec` |
| MTP3 | `--spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 --lm-head-draft` |
| DFlash block=8 | `--spec dflash --draft-tokens 7 --lm-head-draft` |

The MTP0 profile uses four Long NIAH prompts with approximately 8K, 64K, 128K, and 256K tokens.
Thinking is disabled and the output budget is 128 tokens. These runs measure prefill throughput,
server-internal time to first token, and baseline decode throughput at each context length. Content
scenarios are not repeated with MTP disabled because they do not change the baseline decode path.

The speculative-decode corpus contains three long-reasoning fixtures with thinking enabled and a
65,536-token output limit, followed by twelve fixtures covering code, story, translation, and
structured output. The cross-scenario fixtures disable thinking and use a 4,096-token output limit.
The tables report actual completion lengths rather than assuming that every request reaches its
limit.

Metrics are computed from the server's unrounded phase timings and speculative-decode counters:

```text
prefill_tok_s = prompt_tokens / prefill_seconds
server_ttft_ms = 1000 * (prepare_seconds + vision_seconds + prefill_seconds)
decode_tok_s = (completion_tokens - 1) / decode_seconds
spec_acceptance = accepted_tokens / drafted_tokens
spec_tokens_per_round = 1 + accepted_tokens / speculative_rounds
```

Decode throughput is a transport/execution measurement, not a correctness score. The response text,
finish reason, and fixture-level structural requirements are audited separately below. A request
that exhausts its output budget or enters a repetition loop remains useful as a sustained-decode
stress sample, but is not presented as a successfully completed task.

## Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4 concurrent MTP3 corpus makespan

This campaign uses the complete speculative-decode corpus described above: three long-reasoning
fixtures and twelve cross-scenario fixtures, each with five fixed seeds, for 75 requests. The
runner shuffles that fixed request set once with seed `20260811` and preserves the same ordered HTTP
send sequence at every concurrency. Exactly C persistent client workers each submit their next
request only after receiving the current response. C=1 is therefore a serial single-request corpus
on one persistent server and supplies the per-fixture Qwen3.8 results in the final section.

Each point starts a fresh server on an RTX 5090 with CUDA 13.1 compile/runtime, CUDA driver API
13.3, stochastic sampling, INT8 group-64 KV, a 1,024-token prefill chunk, CUDA Graphs, prefix reuse
disabled, a 131,072-token per-request context ceiling, `--kv-capacity auto`, and
`--spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 --lm-head-draft`. Makespan begins when all client workers are released
and ends when the final complete HTTP response has been read. Prefill and decode rates divide the
corresponding server token totals by that full makespan; average batch includes the entire run,
including workload transitions and drain.

| C | Requests | Computed prefill tokens | Decode tokens | Makespan (s) | Requests/s | Prefill tok/s | Decode tok/s | Avg batch | MTP acceptance | Speedup vs. C1 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 75 | 15,460 | 752,160 | 4,670.27 | 0.0161 | 3.3 | 161.1 | 1.00 | 60.8% | 1.00× |
| 2 | 75 | 15,460 | 739,951 | 2,510.78 | 0.0299 | 6.2 | 294.7 | 1.98 | 59.2% | 1.86× |
| 4 | 75 | 15,460 | 713,384 | 1,647.74 | 0.0455 | 9.4 | 432.9 | 3.29 | 58.0% | 2.83× |
| 8 | 75 | 15,460 | 723,602 | 2,164.90 | 0.0346 | 7.1 | 334.2 | 2.36 | 57.6% | 2.16× |

All 300 requests completed without a request, CUDA, or out-of-memory failure. C=4 gives the
shortest complete-corpus makespan. C=8 is limited by memory pressure, which constrains effective
batching and makes the end-to-end result slower than C=4. Sampling is stochastic: prompts, seeds,
and send order are fixed, but concurrency-specific numerical routes can change sampled
continuations and their lengths. The makespan speedup is therefore a fixed-workload serving result
rather than a fixed-token normalization; the exact decode-token totals are retained in the table.

## Concurrent MTP3 decode saturation

The concurrent campaign uses the `long_decode_aime26_15` fixture with thinking enabled. The
rendered prompt is 293 tokens, and every request has an 8,192-token output budget. For each
concurrency C, the runner starts a fresh `ninfer-serve` process with `max_concurrency=C`, releases
C non-stream requests together using distinct fixed seeds, and waits for every HTTP response.
Startup and server warmup occur before the measured wave.

All points use an RTX 5090, CUDA 13.1 compile/runtime, CUDA driver API 13.3, stochastic sampling
(temperature 0.6, top-p 0.95, top-k 20, presence penalty 1.0), INT8 group-64 KV, a 1,024-token
prefill chunk, CUDA Graphs, prefix reuse disabled, and
`--spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 --lm-head-draft`. Each request has a 16,384-token context ceiling.
`--kv-capacity auto` resolved to exactly `C * 16,384` tokens at every point.

Saturated throughput uses only complete one-second server intervals satisfying all of the following:

- computed prefill tokens are zero;
- `running=C`, `prefilling=0`, and `decode_ready=C`;
- at least one decode round completed;
- every decode round had exactly C rows.

Ramp-up, prefill, and drain intervals are excluded. The reported aggregate rate is:

```text
steady_decode_tok_s = sum(committed_decode_tokens) / sum(interval_seconds)
```

Wave makespan starts when the client threads are released and ends after the last complete HTTP
response. MTP acceptance is aggregated over the complete wave. Each row below is one sustained
wave rather than a repeated-sample mean.

| Model profile | C | Steady (s) | Avg batch | Aggregate decode tok/s | MTP acceptance | Speedup vs. C1 | Wave makespan (s) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen3.6-27B `groupwise-int` | 1 | 43.01 | 1.00 | 185.8 | 68.2% | 1.00× | 44.23 |

| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B `groupwise-int` | 2 | 17.00 | 2.00 | 877.7 | 68.2% | 1.48× | 18.87 |

All 45 requests reached their output limit, producing 368,640 completion tokens. The campaign
contained 608 complete full-batch steady intervals and had no request, CUDA, or out-of-memory
failure. At C=8, available device memory after startup was 2.66 GiB for 27B groupwise-int,
2.18 GiB for 27B NVFP4, and 4.38 GiB for 35B-A3B.

## Dual-GPU (TP2) and YaRN 1M context

This inherited campaign was measured on the Qwen3.8-27B
NVFP4 artifact across two RTX 5090s with `--tp 2 --devices 0,1`, INT8 group-64 KV, CUDA Graphs
enabled, and greedy decoding. The extended-context rows additionally use
`--rope yarn --yarn-factor 4.0 --yarn-origin 262144`.

**Power condition.** The campaign was measured with both GPUs held at a **400 W per-GPU cap** --
the minimum settable limit on these cards; the vendor defaults on the measurement host are 600 W
and 575 W, and the maximum is 600 W on both. Sampled draw sat at 346-353 W against the cap, so the
limit was binding. The publishable subset was then **re-measured with both cards at 575 W**, and
the tables below carry both conditions. Lifting the cap helps `--tp 1` considerably more than
`--tp 2`: one card running the whole model saturates its limit (peak sampled draw 575.5 W) while
two cards sharing it peak at 391 and 406 W, so the TP2-over-TP1 decode advantage narrows from
1.44x to 1.40x. Never quote a figure from this section without its power condition. The single-GPU
campaigns above were measured under neither condition and are not comparable to these rows.

### Method

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| GPUs | 2 x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, 32 GiB, no NVLink, peer-to-peer unavailable |
| Power limit | 400 W per GPU (campaign) and 575 W per GPU (re-measurement); vendor defaults 600 W / 575 W, maximum 600 W on both cards |
| Artifact | Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4 |
| Tensor parallel | `--tp 2 --devices 0,1` |
| KV cache | INT8 group-64 |
| CUDA Graph | Enabled |
| Prefill chunk | 1,024 tokens |
| Sampling | Greedy (exact argmax) unless a row states otherwise |
| Rope | `native` at 262k; `yarn` factor 4.0, origin 262,144 above it |
| MTP3 | `--spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 --lm-head-draft` |

### Single request, matched 249,955-token prompt

Byte-identical prompt on both widths, 512 generated tokens. TP1 ran at `--max-context 252928`,
the largest window that fits one card after weights; TP2 ran at the full `262144`.

| Metric | TP1 @400 W | TP2 @400 W | TP2/TP1 | TP1 @575 W | TP2 @575 W | TP2/TP1 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Prefill tok/s | 2,269.8 | 2,680.1 | 1.18x | 2,484.2 | 2,787.0 | 1.12x |
| Decode tok/s, MTP off | 52.35 | 75.18 | 1.44x | 53.95 | 75.32 | 1.40x |
| Decode tok/s, MTP3 | 101.7 | 152.1 | 1.50x | 113.60 | 159.39 | 1.40x |
| MTP3 draft acceptance | 50.83% | 57.96% | 1.14x | 50.83% | 57.96% | 1.14x |
| Time to first token, s | 111.0 | 93.7 | 0.84x | 101.0 | 90.0 | 0.89x |
| Per-GPU resident memory | 27.90 GiB (one card) | 15.04 GiB (each card) | | 27.90 GiB | 15.04 GiB | |
| Peak sampled draw, MTP off | — | — | | 575.5 W | 390.9 / 405.7 W | |
| Peak sampled draw, MTP3 | — | — | | 575.8 W | 483.8 / 444.5 W | |

Draft acceptance is identical to four decimal places across the two power conditions (0.5083 and
0.5796), which is the expected result: power changes timing, not arithmetic.

On a 536-token reasoning prompt the same comparison is 152.0 to 189.5 decode tok/s and 56.61% to
58.06% acceptance. TP1 wins short-prompt prefill (7,582 versus 5,451 tok/s at 8,147 tokens), where
the cross-device collectives are not amortized by a long chunked prefill. **Both of these
short-prompt comparisons were measured at the 400 W per-GPU cap only** and were not re-measured at
575 W, so they must not be read against the 575 W rows above.

### Saturated concurrent decode at a 262,144-token window

One server per concurrency point, `--decode-tokens 8192`, stochastic sampling, aggregate committed
decode tok/s over complete full-batch intervals.

| Concurrency | MTP off @400 W | Speedup | MTP3 @400 W | Speedup | MTP off @575 W | MTP3 @575 W |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 93.5 | 1.00x | 172.4 | 1.00x | 94.1 | 177.8 |
| 2 | 183.0 | 1.96x | 287.0 | 1.67x | not re-measured | not re-measured |
| 4 | 314.3 | 3.36x | 466.0 | 2.70x | 320.3 (3.40x) | 475.2 (2.67x) |

MTP raises absolute throughput at every point while scaling less steeply from batching, which is
consistent with its single-lane throughput already sitting closer to the ceiling batching pushes
toward. Engine-accounted per-GPU memory at C=4 was 14.97 GiB (MTP off) and 15.64 GiB (MTP3).

### Extended context, single request

Served from one `ninfer-serve` process at `--max-context 1048576 --max-concurrency 1`. Prefill and
decode are the server's own phase timings.

| Prompt tokens | MTP | Power | Prefill tok/s | Prefill wall | Decode tok/s |
|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 8,146 | off | 400 W | 5,517.5 | 1.5 s | 97.89 |
| 652,954-652,955 | off | 400 W | 1,348.4 | 484.2 s | 58.22 |
| 652,954-652,955 | off | 400 W (re-run) | 1,379.5 | 470.7-476.0 s | 58.69 |
| 1,045,954-1,045,955 | off | 400 W | 928.9 | 1,126.0 s (18.8 min) | 46.39 |
| 1,045,954-1,045,955 | off | 575 W | 975.1 | 1,072.6 s (17.9 min) | 48.08 |
| 1,045,954 | off, 512 generated | 575 W | 971.4 | 1,076.7 s | 46.11 |
| 1,045,954 | MTP3, 512 generated | 575 W | 975.0 | 1,072.7 s | 100.54 at 56.41% acceptance |
| 949,885 | off | 400 W | 1,011.89 | 938.7 s | 45.49 |
| 949,885 | MTP3 | 400 W | 1,010.19 | — | 99.51 at 58.65% acceptance |

The two 512-generated-token rows are a **like-for-like** MTP measurement: same prompt, same window,
same token budget, so their ratio -- **2.18x** -- needs none of the cross-window caveat the
949,885-token pair in the same table carries. The 24-token rows are needle requests, whose decode
average starts and ends at a lower position. The 400 W and "400 W (re-run)" rows at 652,954 tokens
are two measurements of the same configuration under the same power condition, taken three days
apart; the 653k tier was not re-measured at 575 W.

Ten 653k requests spread 0.3% in prefill rate and ten 1M requests spread 1.4% over a 4.5-hour run:
no thermal fade and no drift. Decode degrades smoothly with context rather than falling off a
cliff, but the decode split policy was tuned at 262k and has not been swept at 1M.

At ~950k tokens MTP3 reaches 99.51 tok/s at 58.65% acceptance on non-repeating greedy text
(400 W). That comparison against 45.49 tok/s was cross-window -- its denominator averaged a decode
from ~950k to the 1,048,576 ceiling while its numerator decoded only ~950k to ~962k -- and it was
quoted as "about 2.2x" for that reason. The like-for-like pair in the table above settles it:
**100.54 against 46.11 tok/s = 2.18x**, same prompt, same window, same 512-token budget, at 575 W.
Acceptance is flat across context: 57.96% at 250k, 58.65% at ~950k, 56.41% at 1,046k.

Two figures from the same run are reported separately and must not be quoted as the headline: a
repetitive greedy stream reaches 93.54% acceptance and 135.78 tok/s, and a
temperature-0.8 sampled stream 80.36% and 122.21 tok/s. Sampled and greedy acceptance are different
algorithms, and the repetitive figure is a loop artifact. Two different degeneration mechanisms
produce those loops: the MTP-off soak stream repeats whole turns because `--ignore-eos` suppresses
its end-of-turn token, while the MTP3 greedy stream contains no end-of-turn token at all and
collapses into a 187-token content-level loop whose first repeat begins at generated index 1,201.
(The 1,341-token acceptance row above is a suffix-period cut, `12,000 - 57 x 187`, not the loop
onset; about 140 of its tokens sit inside the loop's first block, so 58.65% is a mild upper bound
on the novel-text figure.) Sampled decoding at temperature 0.8 does not loop.

### Memory, per GPU

`Resident` is `nvidia-smi` per-process memory. It was flat across every sample of every run: a 1M
prefill adds nothing to the residency chosen at load, and the workspace peaked at 112.29 MiB inside
a 182.81 MiB reservation during a 949,863-token prefill.

| Context | MTP | Weights | Sequence | Workspace | Reserved | Resident |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 262,144 | off | 10.08 GiB | 4.28 GiB | 0.18 GiB | — | 15.04 GiB |
| 262,144 | MTP3 | 10.46 GiB | 4.54 GiB | 0.19 GiB | — | 15.69 GiB |
| 1,048,576 | off | 10.08 GiB | 16.66 GiB | 182.81 MiB | 26.93 GiB | 27.41 GiB |
| 1,048,576 | MTP3 | 10.46 GiB | 17.69 GiB | 192.93 MiB | 28.42 GiB | 28.84 GiB |

`Reserved` is the CLI load summary's per-device row; the 262,144-token rows were measured through
`ninfer-serve`'s startup record and `nvidia-smi` instead. The gap of about 0.48 GiB between
`Reserved` and `Resident` is the CUDA context and driver-side allocations the planner does not
count, so the summary's `planned slack` over-reports free memory by that much. CUDA Graph residency
at 1M was 2.00-3.00 MiB per device against a 20.00 MiB allowance.

Turning MTP3 on costs a measured 1.49 GiB of reserved memory per device at 1,048,576 tokens and
0.65 GiB at 262,144. Its two dominant terms are 0.38 GiB of head weights, fixed at any window, and
1.03 GiB of MTP KV per 1M tokens of window; the remainder of each measured delta is workspace and
sequence-arena rounding. At 1M with MTP3 the margin to a 30 GiB per-device budget is 1.16 GiB.

### Reproduction

The dual-GPU campaign is driven by the same concurrency runner as the single-GPU tables, with the
tensor-parallel flags added:

```bash
python3 tools/bench/run_serve_concurrency.py \
  --serve build/apps/ninfer-serve \
  --artifact qwen3_8_27b=out/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --mode mtp3 --suite decode-saturation --concurrency 1 --concurrency 2 --concurrency 4 \
  --tp 2 --devices 0,1 --device 0 \
  --max-context 262144 --kv-capacity 262144 \
  --output profiles/bench/tp2_decode_saturation
```

The extended-context rows are single requests against a server started with the 1M configuration:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve out/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --tp 2 --devices 0,1 \
  --rope yarn --yarn-factor 4.0 --yarn-origin 262144 \
  --max-context 1048576 --kv-capacity auto --kv-dtype int8 \
  --max-concurrency 1 --prefill-chunk 1024 \
  --request-log-jsonl run.requests.jsonl
```

Read prefill and decode from that log's `request_done.timings_seconds`, and confirm the power
condition with `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=power.limit,power.default_limit,power.draw --format=csv`
before quoting any figure.

### Cross-engine comparison against vLLM (NVFP4, 500 W per GPU)

This comparison is a **third power condition**: both cards capped at **500 W per GPU**, distinct
from the 400 W campaign and the 575 W re-measurement above. Rows from the three conditions are not
comparable with each other.

One request at a time, byte-identical needle-in-a-haystack prompts at three context tiers, 512
output tokens, temperature 0, thinking off, and a freshly booted server per tier on both sides so
that every prefill is genuinely cold -- zero prefix-cache hits, verified from each engine's own
counters. `Prefill tok/s` is `prompt_tokens / TTFT`; `decode tok/s` is measured client-side over
the streamed window. `Peak VRAM/GPU` is the peak the engine's own process held on each device, and
peak draw comes from a 3 s sampler. Every row below was taken at the 500 W per-GPU cap.

| Engine | Window served | Tier | MTP | Prompt tokens | TTFT (s) | Prefill tok/s | Decode tok/s | Total (s) | Peak VRAM/GPU | Peak draw (GPU0 / GPU1) |
|---|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| vLLM 0.25.1 | 750,000 | 250k | MTP3 | 249,955 | 79.14 | **3,158.5** | 110.78 | 83.75 | 28.90 GiB | 443.9 / 467.6 W |
| vLLM 0.25.1 | 750,000 | 653k | MTP3 | 652,955 | 353.84 | **1,845.3** | 41.94 | 366.03 | 29.00 GiB | 473.6 / 496.4 W |
| vLLM 0.25.1 | 750,000 | 700k | MTP3 | 699,955 | 402.56 | **1,738.8** | 41.01 | 415.02 | 28.90 GiB | 475.3 / 497.7 W |
| NInfer TP2 | 1,048,576 | 250k | off | 249,955 | 92.56 | 2,700.5 | 73.35 | 99.51 | 27.41 GiB | 385.2 / 396.8 W |
| NInfer TP2 | 1,048,576 | 250k | MTP3 | 249,955 | 91.66 | 2,726.9 | **155.80** | 94.93 | 28.84 GiB | 380.9 / 373.6 W |
| NInfer TP2 | 1,048,576 | 653k | off | 652,955 | 465.82 | 1,401.7 | 56.70 | 474.81 | 27.41 GiB | 414.1 / 440.0 W |
| NInfer TP2 | 1,048,576 | 653k | MTP3 | 652,955 | 471.01 | 1,386.3 | **118.74** | 475.28 | 28.84 GiB | 475.3 / 488.1 W |
| NInfer TP2 | 1,048,576 | 700k | off | 699,955 | 529.26 | 1,322.5 | 54.84 | 538.55 | 27.41 GiB | 415.2 / 458.8 W |
| NInfer TP2 | 1,048,576 | 700k | MTP3 | 699,955 | 532.42 | 1,314.7 | **103.42** | 537.33 | 28.84 GiB | 465.0 / 463.0 W |

vLLM 0.25.1 served `unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4` at `--tensor-parallel-size 2` with FP8 KV, YaRN x4
injected through `--hf-overrides`, `--max-model-len 750000`, `--max-num-batched-tokens 16768`,
FlashInfer, and `--speculative-config '{"method":"mtp","num_speculative_tokens":3}'`. Its
speculative configuration is fixed at launch, so all three of its rows are MTP3. NInfer served its
own NVFP4 artifact at `--tp 2 --rope yarn --yarn-factor 4.0 --yarn-origin 262144
--max-context 1048576 --kv-dtype int8 --prefill-chunk 1024`.

The two engines counted **identical prompt token totals at every tier** -- 249,955 / 652,955 /
699,955, each server tokenizing the same prompt string independently. That is the evidence that
they were given the same input.

**Prefill goes to vLLM at every tier**, by 1.17x at 250k, 1.32x at 653k and 1.32x at 700k:
3,158.5 / 1,845.3 / 1,738.8 tok/s against NInfer's 2,700.5 / 1,401.7 / 1,322.5. The most likely
single cause is prefill chunking -- vLLM batches up to 16,768 tokens per prefill step, NInfer
1,024 -- and that is a tunable rather than a ceiling. It was not swept.

**Decode goes to NInfer, and the cause is vLLM's speculative acceptance past its native window.**
That deployment's native window is 262,144 tokens; beyond it, its MTP head still drafts 3 tokens
per step and has every one rejected. Acceptance measured from each engine's own counters, for
exactly the requests in the table:

| Tier | vLLM drafted / accepted | vLLM acceptance | NInfer drafted / accepted | NInfer acceptance |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 250k | 606 / 311 | 51.3% | 567 / 322 | 56.8% |
| 653k | 1,533 / **0** | **0.0%** | 547 / 328 | 60.0% |
| 700k | 1,533 / **0** | **0.0%** | 602 / 310 | 51.5% |

So vLLM pays the drafter's cost for nothing at 653k and 700k, and its decode falls to 41.94 and
41.01 tok/s. NInfer's acceptance is flat across the same range, and its MTP3 decode is **2.83x and
2.52x** vLLM's there (118.74 and 103.42 tok/s). NInfer's MTP-*off* decode at those tiers (56.70 and
54.84 tok/s) already beats vLLM's speculative decode. At 250k, where vLLM's speculation still
works, vLLM decodes 110.78 tok/s against NInfer's 155.80 with MTP3 and 73.35 with MTP off.

**Context ceiling and memory.** vLLM's KV pool measured 759,297 tokens at boot (12.73 GiB, FP8,
`--gpu-memory-utilization 0.85`), with 28.90-29.00 GiB held per GPU. NInfer holds 1,048,576 tokens
-- 38% more window -- in 27.41 GiB per GPU with MTP off and 28.84 GiB with MTP3. The 700k tier sits
near vLLM's ceiling and comfortably inside NInfer's. A second boot of the same vLLM configuration
measured 760,847 tokens; the pool varies by about 0.2% between boots with the free-memory profile
at launch.

**End to end at 512 output tokens, vLLM finishes first at every tier**, because a request of that
shape is almost entirely prefill. NInfer's decode advantage repays its slower prefill beyond
roughly **4,800 output tokens at 250k, 7,600 at 653k and 8,800 at 700k** (NInfer MTP3 against
vLLM). The Qwen3.8 card's own guidance for a 1M window -- up to 262k tokens of reasoning and 131k
of final response on agentic tasks -- sits far above all three break-even points.

#### Caveats on the cross-engine rows

- **Different weights.** vLLM served `unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4`, an NVFP4 quantization of the base
  Qwen3.8-27B fine-tune; NInfer served its own conversion of the huihui abliterated fine-tune.
  These are different quantizations of different fine-tunes. The comparison is *engine plus
  quantization pipeline*, not a controlled same-weights benchmark. Architecture, layer count and
  hidden sizes are identical, so the prefill and decode arithmetic has the same shape, but nothing
  here isolates the engine from the checkpoint.
- **Different KV dtypes.** vLLM FP8, NInfer INT8. That affects both the memory rows and attention
  bandwidth, so it is present in both the prefill and the decode columns.
- **Different prefill chunking, unswept.** vLLM `--max-num-batched-tokens 16768` against NInfer
  `--prefill-chunk 1024`, the value the 1M configuration ships with. Neither was swept.
- **No vLLM MTP-off row.** Speculative decoding is fixed at launch and turning it off needs a
  restart with a different `--speculative-config`; that run was not made. vLLM's 653k and 700k rows
  are therefore MTP-off *behaviour* at MTP-on *cost*, which is worse than a true MTP-off run would
  be.
- **No quality claim.** Both engines ran at `temperature 0`, `seed 42`, 512 max tokens, but their
  rejection-sampling paths under speculative decoding are not guaranteed identical and no
  token-level equivalence was checked. This is a throughput comparison only.
- **n = 1 per cell.** Each row is a single request.
- **The 500 W NInfer 250k rows are not a like-for-like re-run of the 575 W 250k rows.** These ran
  YaRN at a 1,048,576-token window, to match vLLM's YaRN deployment; the 575 W rows ran native rope
  at 262,144. The roughly 2% difference between them combines the lower cap with the window change
  and does not separate the two.
- **The vLLM client needed a wrapper.** That server runs `--reasoning-parser qwen3`, which routes
  output to `delta.reasoning_content`, and it ignores a top-level `enable_thinking` field (its
  equivalent is `chat_template_kwargs`). The project probe reads `delta.content` and sends the
  top-level field, so the vLLM rows were taken with a wrapper client that times the first delta on
  either channel and sends `chat_template_kwargs={"enable_thinking": false}`. Every vLLM row
  reports its tokens arriving on the `content` channel, so thinking was off on both sides.

Two further points about vLLM's extended context, independent of the table:

- **Extended context in vLLM is a checkpoint property, not a serving flag.** An NVFP4 repackaging
  that ships without a YaRN block in `config.json` `rope_parameters` is capped at its
  `max_position_embeddings` (262,144) until one is injected at load. `--hf-overrides` does exactly
  that, and vLLM then serves this checkpoint far beyond 262,144 tokens. The difference from NInfer
  is **where the configuration lives** -- a serving flag on an unmodified artifact here, a
  checkpoint-config override there -- not a capability difference.
- **A prefix-cache measurement, not a comparison row.** One extra vLLM run replayed the identical
  250k prompt on the same server: 248,000 of 249,955 tokens served from the prefix cache (99.22%),
  TTFT 1.80 s instead of 79.14 s, decode unchanged at 108.75 tok/s.

The raw probe records, per-request server logs, power and VRAM samples, speculative counters and
the full methodology are committed under
[`eval/results/cross-engine-nvfp4/`](../eval/results/cross-engine-nvfp4/README.md).

### Measurement gaps in this campaign

- **Concurrency C=2 was measured at the 400 W cap only**; the 575 W re-measurement covered C=1 and
  C=4, and the 653k extended-context tier was not re-measured at 575 W.
- **The soak is greedy only.** A seeded temperature > 0 soak, as the decode-coverage complement, has
  not been run.
- **The cross-engine comparison has no vLLM MTP-off row**, because speculative decoding is fixed at
  vLLM's launch and that restart was not made, and **the prefill-chunk difference was not swept** on
  either engine (`--prefill-chunk 1024` against `--max-num-batched-tokens 16768`).

The design decisions and correctness gates behind these numbers are in
[Dual-GPU (TP2) execution and YaRN 1M context](maintainer/tp2-yarn-1m.md).

### DFlash block=8 (`k=7`), stochastic sampling

The fixtures, five seeds, sampling parameters, and output limits are identical to MTP3. Different
speculative backends consume random values differently, so this is a fixed-workload comparison
rather than a token-identical paired-output comparison.

### DFlash block=8 (`k=7`), greedy sampling

Greedy uses exact argmax; all other corpus and server settings remain unchanged. The five seeds
repeat the same deterministic generation path, so within-fixture standard deviation measures
runtime variation rather than output variation.

#### Long-reasoning decode

| Fixture | Samples | Completion tokens | Decode tok/s | DFlash acceptance | DFlash tokens/round |

† The generation is a deterministic repetition loop, not a valid AIME response. The raw rate is
retained to describe what was measured, but is excluded from performance comparisons.

### Speculative-decode output audit

The audit covers all 225 stored July responses from the 35B-A3B MTP3 stochastic-sampler, DFlash
stochastic-sampler, and DFlash greedy campaigns. It checks termination, exact repetition, and
fixture-specific mechanical constraints. AIME 1 was checked algebraically; the AIME 30 answer
(`393`) was checked by independent enumeration. This audit does not attempt to assign a subjective
quality score to prose or translations.

#### Long-reasoning answers

| Fixture | MTP3 stochastic sampler | DFlash stochastic sampler | DFlash greedy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `long_decode_aime26_01` | 5/5 correct, natural stop | 5/5 correct, natural stop | 5/5 correct, natural stop |
| `long_decode_aime26_15` | 0/5 answers; all reach 65,536-token limit | 0/5 answers; all reach 65,536-token limit | 0/5 answers; all reach 65,536-token limit |
| `long_decode_aime26_30` | 3/5 correct, 1 wrong, 1 no answer | 2/5 correct, 1 wrong, 2 no answer | 0/5 answers; all enter the same repetition loop |

The greedy AIME 30 response has an empty final-content field and fills its 65,536-token reasoning
budget. The exact line `Wait, $x_7 x_1 x_3$ is $x_7 x_1 x_3$.` occurs 2,406 times among 2,538
non-empty reasoning lines. Its 98.0% acceptance and 994.9 tok/s therefore characterize a highly
predictable pathological loop, not normal reasoning performance.

AIME 15 is also not a valid completion in any of the three campaigns: every sample exhausts the
budget without a boxed answer. Its output is long, non-convergent reasoning rather than the short
exact cycle seen in greedy AIME 30. The AIME 15 rates may be read only as sustained long-decode
throughput.

#### Cross-scenario outputs

| Category | MTP3 stochastic sampler | DFlash stochastic sampler | DFlash greedy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Code | 1/15 natural stops; 0/15 prompt-complete | 2/15 natural stops; 0/15 prompt-complete | 0/15 natural stops |
| Story | 9/15 natural stops; the nine Chinese outputs pass requested division and minimum length | 8/15 natural stops; the eight Chinese outputs pass requested division and minimum length | 10/15 natural stops; five Chinese dialogue outputs are under length |
| Translation | 15/15 natural stops; 15/15 pass structural checks | 15/15 natural stops; 15/15 pass structural checks | 15/15 natural stops; 15/15 pass structural checks |
| Structured | 0/15 satisfy the requested complete record/script contract | 0/15 satisfy the requested complete record/script contract | 0/15 satisfy the requested complete record/script contract |

The code prompts require complete runnable multi-file deliverables, but almost all outputs end at the
4,096-token limit. The three natural-stop exceptions also contain decisive contract failures: the
MTP3 CUDA response substitutes CUDA 12.8 and an older architecture list; the DFlash CUDA response
copies FP32 input into a half-sized 16-bit allocation and passes raw `unsigned short` values to BF16
intrinsics; and the DFlash Python response never writes its advertised JSONL event stream to the
configured log file. Code throughput is therefore a truncated-generation stress result, not
successful code-generation throughput.

All English mystery samples reach the output limit with an unfinished ending. The naturally stopped
Chinese stories have the requested chapter/act counts; the MTP3 and stochastic-DFlash samples also
meet their requested Chinese-character minima. Greedy's five dialogue stories contain 3,239 Chinese
characters each, below the requested 3,500. Story results are consequently a mixed normal/truncated
workload.

All translation outputs stop naturally. Each plain-document result preserves six sections and
provides at least twenty glossary entries; each Markdown result preserves heading levels, the
six-line table, all required inline identifiers, and the exact fenced JSON object. Translation is
the cleanest cross-scenario normal-completion comparison in this corpus.

The structured prompts intentionally exceed what these generations fit into 4,096 tokens. MTP3,
stochastic DFlash, and greedy DFlash produce only 49–60, 49–58, and 57 valid JSONL records,
respectively, versus the requested 160. Their complete-width CSV ranges are 122–139, 121–143, and
133 rows versus the requested 220. No SQL output satisfies all four tables, two views, at least 80
rows, and six final analytical queries. These high-acceptance results describe predictable partial
record generation only.

The exact-line and repeated-token scan found no other response with a short-cycle collapse comparable
to greedy AIME 30. Output-limit and prompt-compliance failures above remain material even when no
repetition loop is present.

### EvalScope reasoning accuracy

Both weight profiles were evaluated through NInfer's OpenAI-compatible serving route with thinking
enabled, MTP=3, and a 262,144-token context limit. EvalScope 1.9.0 used 0-shot prompts, rule-based
scoring, and one sample per problem with temperature 0.6, top-p 0.95, top-k 20, presence penalty
1.0, and seed 42. All 258 samples completed and were scored for each profile.

| Weights ID | AIME 2025 | AIME 2026 | GPQA-Diamond |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `groupwise-int` | 86.67% (26 / 30) | 93.33% (28 / 30) | 86.87% (172 / 198) |
| `nvfp4` | 93.33% (28 / 30) | 93.33% (28 / 30) | 84.34% (167 / 198) |

These are single-sample results under the stated evaluation profile, not pass@k scores. Each
benchmark remains independently reportable; no combined score is computed.

### `nvfp4`

The fixtures, seeds, sampling parameters, output limits, and runtime options are identical to the
groupwise-int serving campaign. Quantization can change sampled tokens, so the MTP3 results are a
fixed-workload comparison rather than a token-identical output comparison.

### `nvfp4`

The MTP0 table comes from the serial Long NIAH campaign described by the single-request method. The
MTP3 tables come from the C=1 point of the fixed concurrent-corpus campaign, which serially runs the
same three long-reasoning and twelve cross-scenario fixtures. Each fixture has five fixed seeds. The
tables report arithmetic mean ± sample standard deviation from the server's per-request phase
timings and speculative counters.
